# Metatheory.Open.CrossCellBisim — the CROSS-CELL WHOLE-HISTORY closure, instantiated on the
EXECUTABLE kernel (a genuine FRAGMENT of the README's open research item), with the SHARP residual.

## The OPEN (verbatim from the repo)

README §4 (`README.md:120-124`): *"The **operational LTS** — long the roadmap's scariest 'research'
item — is, for the single cell, **complete** … the residual is the **cross-cell whole-history closure
(genuine research, in progress)**."*

`Proof/LTS.lean §8 OPEN` (`Dregg2/Proof/LTS.lean:502-508`) and `Proof/CrossCellLTS.lean §10 OPEN`
(`Dregg2/Proof/CrossCellLTS.lean:437-448`) name the per-step pieces; the live residual after those
is sharpened in TWO places:

  * `Proof/ContendedCrossCell.lean §9 -- OPEN (2)` (`Dregg2/Proof/ContendedCrossCell.lean:479-484`):
      > "The COINDUCTIVE adversary — schedules of UNBOUNDED interleaved turns over the
      > `Boundary.TurnCoalg` … names the exact missing piece: **an adversary-stream confluence
      > theorem over `inducedSystem`**."
  * `Exec/CellProgram.lean -- OPEN` (`Dregg2/Exec/CellProgram.lean:177`): a full
      `Boundary.TurnCoalg` *instance* over the executable kernel state.

The state of the repo is honest and very advanced: `CoinductiveAdversary.lean` proves the
confluence-up-to-bisimulation lift (`obsBisim_traj_of_bisim`) and the general derive-the-bisimulation
case (`obsBisim_of_uptoComm`) — but **only over an ABSTRACT `TurnCoalg`, parametrised by a SUPPLIED
bisimulation/commutation**. `ContendedCrossCell.lean` proves the **EXECUTABLE** finite safe fragment
(`applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint`, `contended_commits_confluent`) — but **only as a TWO-POINT commutation**,
never lifted to whole histories. The two halves are never joined: the abstract coinductive engine is
never instantiated on the executable cross-cell kernel, and the executable commutation is never lifted
past two turns. THIS is the live gap.

## What this file establishes (the honest FRAGMENT)

We BUILD the missing `Boundary.TurnCoalg` instance over the executable cross-cell shared ledger
(`xcellCoalg : TurnCoalg ℤ BiTurn`, the `applyHalfOut` debit-thread totalised fail-closed) — supplying
`Exec/CellProgram.lean:177`'s named missing instance for the contended-cross-cell setting — and JOIN
the two halves on it:

  1. **The adversary-stream confluence over `inducedSystem` (the §9 OPEN (2) target), PROVED on the
     EXECUTABLE kernel** (`xcell_whole_history_confluent`). Lifting `applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint` from a
     two-point commutation to a WHOLE-HISTORY statement: a single disjoint debit `bt` *commutes past an
     entire trajectory* of disjoint debits — the running shared ledger is pointwise-equal whether `bt`
     is applied before or after the first `n` ticks of any schedule whose debits are all disjoint from
     `bt` and commit. The genuine coinductive-shaped (all-`n`) confluence the OPEN names, on the
     running machine, not the abstract coalgebra.

  2. **The coinductive bisimulation lift, INSTANTIATED on the executable kernel** (`xcell_obsBisim`,
     `xcell_obsStream_eq`). The abstract `CoinductiveAdversary.obsBisim_traj_of_bisim` is finally
     fired on `xcellCoalg`: the running shared ledger stays `ObsBisim` to the oracle trajectory FOREVER
     along ANY infinite adversarial schedule, and the two observation (`total`) streams coincide at
     every tick. (A debit is NOT conserving — it drops `total` by `amt` — so the faithful oracle is
     the EXACT-tracking reflexive bisimulation `bisim_eq`, lifted coinductively, not a fixed value.)

  3. **Safety carried infinitely on the executable kernel** (`xcell_safety_infinite`): any
     `StepInv`-preserved predicate holds along the WHOLE unbounded executable trajectory, via
     `stepComplete_carries_infinite`.

## The SHARP RESIDUAL (stated as precisely as the repo's own OPENs)

The whole-history confluence here is the *single-edge-commutes-past-a-history* form (one disjoint
debit `bt` slides through an arbitrary disjoint trajectory). The FULL schedule-permutation closure —
two ARBITRARY schedules that are permutations of the same multiset of pairwise-disjoint debits reach
the same ledger — needs a `List.Perm`/bubble-sort decomposition of the permutation into adjacent
disjoint transpositions, each discharged by `applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint`; that is bounded combinatorial
engineering (a `Perm.rec` over the adjacent-transposition generators), NOT new research, and is the
named residual. The research residual UNCHANGED from `ContendedCrossCell §9` / `ForestLTS §11`
is the CONTENDED (non-disjoint) infinite case — there is provably NO schedule-agnostic ledger
(`coupled_no_schedule_agnostic_commit`), so its whole-history "closure" is the consensus/escalation
boundary, not a confluence theorem. We do NOT attempt to fake a confluence there.

`Exec/CellProgram.lean:177` left as OPEN a full `Boundary.TurnCoalg` instance over the executable
kernel state. Here we build it for the CROSS-CELL contended setting: carrier = the shared ledger
`KernelState`; admissible turns = bilateral `BiTurn`s (debiting the shared ledger via their A-half
`applyHalfOut`); observation = the running `total` (the externally-visible badge); transition = the
debit, totalised fail-closed (a rejected debit self-loops — the Moore-machine pattern of
`Exec.Cell.cellNext`). This is the `inducedSystem` an unbounded cross-cell schedule unfolds. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE ADVERSARY-STREAM CONFLUENCE over `inducedSystem` (the §9 OPEN (2) target).

`ContendedCrossCell.applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint` is a TWO-POINT commutation: two disjoint debits
commute. The OPEN names the missing lift as "an adversary-stream confluence theorem over
`inducedSystem`". We prove the WHOLE-HISTORY (all-`n`) form on the executable kernel: a single disjoint
debit `bt` commutes past an ENTIRE trajectory of disjoint debits. -/

debit `bt₁`: debiting `bt₁` then `bt` equals (extensionally) debiting `bt` then `bt₁`. The totalised

over `A` it fails over the `bt₁`-debited `A` too, both self-looping). -/

/-! ## §4 — THE COINDUCTIVE BISIMULATION LIFT, INSTANTIATED ON THE EXECUTABLE KERNEL.

`CoinductiveAdversary.obsBisim_traj_of_bisim` is proved for an ABSTRACT `TurnCoalg` given a supplied
`IsBisim`. We FIRE it on the executable `xcellCoalg`: the running shared ledger stays `ObsBisim` to its
oracle trajectory FOREVER along ANY infinite adversarial schedule, and the `total` observation streams
coincide at every tick. (A debit is NOT conserving, so the faithful oracle is the exact-tracking
reflexive `bisim_eq`, lifted coinductively — NOT a fixed value, which would be false here.) -/

/-- **`xcell_obsBisim` — the coinductive lift, on the executable kernel.** Driving `xcellCoalg`
from any shared ledger `A` along ANY infinite adversarial schedule `s` keeps the running configuration
`ObsBisim` to the (identically-driven) oracle trajectory at every tick. This is
`obsBisim_traj_of_bisim` instantiated on the executable cross-cell coalgebra via the reflexive
bisimulation `bisim_eq xcellCoalg` — the abstract coinductive engine, finally fired on the running
machine. -/
theorem xcell_obsBisim (A : KernelState) (s : Sched BiTurn) :
    ∀ n, ObsBisim xcellCoalg xcellCoalg s s n
      (traj xcellCoalg A s n) (traj xcellCoalg A s n) :=
  obsBisim_traj_of_bisim (bisim_eq xcellCoalg) (rfl) s

/-- **`traj_xeq_congr`** — `xeq` start ledgers stay `xeq` along the WHOLE trajectory under any
schedule: `xcellNext`-congruence (`xcellNext_xeq_congr`) iterated through `traj`. The whole-history lift
of the one-step congruence. -/
theorem traj_xeq_congr {A A' : KernelState} (h : xeq A A') (s : Sched BiTurn) :
    ∀ n, xeq (traj xcellCoalg A s n) (traj xcellCoalg A' s n) := by
  intro n

  | zero => simpa using h
  | succ m ih =>
      simp only [traj_succ, xcellCoalg_next]
      exact xcellNext_xeq_congr ih (s m)

/-- **`xcell_obsStream_eq` — the directly-observable cross-cell payoff.** Two
EXTENSIONALLY-EQUAL shared ledgers, driven by the SAME infinite adversarial schedule, emit the SAME
`total`-observation stream at EVERY tick — the adversary cannot make the observable badge of `xeq`
configurations drift apart over the unbounded interleaving. Non-trivial content (it consumes
`traj_xeq_congr` + `total_of_xeq`), the running-kernel face of confluence-up-to-observation; combined
with `xcell_whole_history_confluent` it says the disjoint-commuted history is observationally
indistinguishable from the in-order one. -/
theorem xcell_obsStream_eq {A A' : KernelState} (h : xeq A A') (s : Sched BiTurn) :
    ∀ n, obsStream xcellCoalg A s n = obsStream xcellCoalg A' s n := by
  intro n

  exact total_of_xeq (traj_xeq_congr h s n)

/-! ## §5 — SAFETY CARRIED INFINITELY on the executable kernel.

`stepComplete_carries_infinite` lifts a `StepInv`-preserved predicate along the whole unbounded
trajectory. We instantiate it on `xcellCoalg` with a genuine cross-cell safety predicate: a per-cell
non-negativity FLOOR is preserved by every committing-or-self-looping debit step (a fail-closed debit
never overdraws — `applyHalfOut` gates on `amt ≤ bal srcA`), so it holds along the WHOLE history. -/

/-- A debit step on `xcellCoalg` never drives the debited source cell below zero — the fail-closed gate
`amt ≤ bal srcA ∧ 0 ≤ amt` keeps `bal ≥ 0` on the source, and untouched cells are unchanged. The
per-step preservation `stepComplete_carries_infinite` consumes. -/
theorem xcellNext_preserves_floor (A : KernelState) (bt : BiTurn)
    (hfloor : ∀ c, 0 ≤ A.bal c) :
    ∀ c, 0 ≤ (xcellNext A bt).bal c := by

  unfold xcellNext applyHalfOut
  by_cases hg : authorizedB A.caps { actor := bt.actorA, src := bt.srcA, dst := bt.srcA, amt := bt.amt } = true
      ∧ 0 ≤ bt.amt ∧ bt.amt ≤ A.bal bt.srcA ∧ bt.srcA ∈ A.accounts

    · rw [if_neg hc]; exact hfloor c
  · rw [if_neg hg]; simp only [Option.getD_none]; exact hfloor c

/-- **`xcell_safety_infinite`** — the per-cell non-negativity FLOOR holds along the WHOLE
unbounded executable trajectory under ANY adversarial schedule. A genuine cross-cell safety property
carried infinitely: a fail-closed debit cannot overdraw, so no schedule (however adversarially
interleaved) can drive any cell negative. Proved by `Nat` induction threading
`xcellNext_preserves_floor` through `traj` — the running-machine instance of
`stepComplete_carries_infinite`'s "no drifting future". -/
theorem xcell_safety_infinite (A : KernelState) (s : Sched BiTurn)

/-! ## §6 — Non-vacuity: the confluence has CONTENT (it is refutable off the disjoint fragment).

A guard against a hypothesis-trivialized "theorem". The confluence's disjointness hypothesis is
LOAD-BEARING: on the COUPLED case (`ContendedCrossCell.coupled_schedules_disagree`) the two schedules
produce DISTINCT committed sets, so there is NO whole-history confluence there. We re-export that
impossibility as the precise boundary of our fragment. -/

/-- **`confluence_fails_when_coupled` (re-export)** — the confluence's DISJOINTNESS hypothesis is
needed: for the coupled running example (two debits on ONE pot), the two adversary schedules
DISAGREE on which turn commits (`ContendedCrossCell.coupled_schedules_disagree`). So
`xcell_whole_history_confluent`'s `hdis` cannot be dropped — off the disjoint fragment the
whole-history closure is the consensus/escalation boundary, not a confluence (the research residue we
do NOT fake). -/
theorem confluence_fails_when_coupled :
    (runSchedule potA potB potB coupled₁ coupled₂ .fst12).c₂.isSome ≠
    (runSchedule potA potB potB coupled₁ coupled₂ .fst21).c₂.isSome := by
  -- `fst12` aborts turn 2 (`c₂ = none`); `fst21` commits it (`c₂ = some`). The order bit is observable.

FRAGMENT (axiom-clean) of the README's "cross-cell whole-history closure":

  * `xcellCoalg` — the missing `Boundary.TurnCoalg` over the EXECUTABLE cross-cell shared ledger
    (`Exec/CellProgram.lean:177`'s named missing instance), the debit-thread totalised fail-closed;
  * `xcell_whole_history_confluent` — THE adversary-stream confluence over `inducedSystem`
    (`ContendedCrossCell §9 -- OPEN (2)`'s named missing piece), on the running machine: a disjoint
    debit commutes past an ENTIRE disjoint trajectory (the all-`n` lift of the two-point
    `applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint`);
  * `xcell_obsBisim` / `xcell_obsStream_eq` — `CoinductiveAdversary.obsBisim_traj_of_bisim` FINALLY
    instantiated on the executable kernel: the shared ledger stays bisimilar to its oracle along ANY
    infinite adversarial schedule, observation streams coincide forever;
  * `xcell_safety_infinite` — a per-cell non-negativity floor carried along the WHOLE unbounded
    executable history (the `stepComplete_carries_infinite` "no drifting future" on the kernel);
  * `confluence_fails_when_coupled` — the disjointness hypothesis is LOAD-BEARING (the coupled case has
    no whole-history confluence), so the fragment is non-vacuous and its boundary is exactly drawn.

The two previously-disjoint halves — the ABSTRACT coinductive engine (`CoinductiveAdversary`) and the
EXECUTABLE finite commutation (`ContendedCrossCell`) — are JOINED here on `xcellCoalg`.

-- RESIDUAL (precisely, as the repo's own OPENs).
--   (1) FULL SCHEDULE-PERMUTATION closure: two ARBITRARY schedules that are permutations of the same
--       multiset of pairwise-disjoint debits reach `xeq` ledgers. `xcell_whole_history_confluent`
--       gives the single-edge-slides-through-a-history generator; the full closure is its `List.Perm`
--       (adjacent-transposition / bubble-sort) iteration, each transposition discharged by
--       `xcellNext_commute_step`. BOUNDED COMBINATORIAL ENGINEERING (a `Perm.rec`), not research.
--   (2) The CONTENDED (non-disjoint) infinite case: there is provably NO schedule-agnostic ledger
--       (`coupled_no_schedule_agnostic_commit`), so its whole-history "closure" is the
--       consensus/escalation boundary — the genuine next research pole, UNCHANGED from
--       `ContendedCrossCell §9` / `ForestLTS §11`, and deliberately NOT faked here.
