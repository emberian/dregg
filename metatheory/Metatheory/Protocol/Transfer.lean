# Metatheory.Protocol.Transfer — an EXECUTABLE two-cell atomic token transfer.

The first *runnable* dregg2 protocol: a concrete instantiation of the abstract stack
(`Core.Conservation`, `Boundary.TurnCoalg`, and the `JointTurn` cross-cell `⊗`) as
actual computable Lean you can `#eval`. Two sovereign account-cells; a transfer is the
canonical CROSS-CELL ATOMIC turn — a debit on the sender ⊗ a credit on the receiver,
committing all-or-nothing (atomicity = the `will_succeed` cumulative AND), with the
amount debited exactly equal to the amount credited (CG-5, the conservation aggregate).

Unlike the abstract modules (whose laws are `sorry`'d obligations to discharge against
the operational model), the protocol-level theorems here are **proved outright** by
computation (`omega`) for the concrete state — worked instances of Law 1 / CG-5 /
atomicity. This is what "dregg2, executable in Lean" looks like at the smallest scale.

/-- **Fail-closed** local application: a lone debit beyond balance is a no-op (the cell
never goes negative — `Nat` has no debt; cf. `Core` conservation needing a group for
signed deltas). -/

/-- **A cell as live codata** — the concrete `Boundary.TurnCoalg`: the observation is the
public balance; the transition applies a `LocalOp`, landing in another live `Acct` (never
a "final state"). This is `νF` made executable for one account-cell. -/

  Carrier := Acct
  step a := (a.bal, fun op => applyLocal a op)

/-- The atomic two-cell transfer: debit sender ⊗ credit receiver, all-or-nothing.

is then no partial credit. -/

guard). Atomicity is this PROOF property, not a live coordinator. -/

#eval (acctCoalg.next alice (.credit 7)).bal   -- 107  (the coalgebra steps as codata)

CG-5 aggregate). -/

/-- **CG-5 (the cross-cell conservation aggregate), proved:** the amount the sender loses
exactly equals the amount the receiver gains — the signed half-edges cancel (`-amt + +amt
= 0`), here as the bilateral `out = in` equality over `Nat`. -/
theorem transfer_cg5 (sender receiver : Acct) (amt : Amount) {s' r' : Acct}

on failure it returns `none`, so NEITHER cell moves (all-or-nothing, no partial credit). -/

/-- **No value created from a failed turn:** a non-committing transfer leaves both cells
exactly as they were (there is no state to read back — `none` — so the cells are
untouched). Stated as: failure ⇒ `willSucceed = false`. -/

/-- **Conservation over an ENTIRE channel execution — PROVED.** For any run of
arbitrarily many transfers in either direction, total supply equals its initial value.
The first dregg2 theorem about a *userspace program's whole execution* (not one turn):
`Execution.invariant_run` lifts the per-step `channel_step_conserves` to the trace. -/
