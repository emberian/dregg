# Metatheory.Coordination — the multiparty-session-type / choreography layer.

This is the **top of the coordination stack** (`dregg2-multicell-privacy.md §6`):

    CellProgram (one cell's coalgebra, `Boundary.lean`)
      → JointTurn (one atomic multi-cell step = Mina's `zkapp_command` forest)
        → **Coordination** (a multi-party, multi-turn, session-typed choreography
           reified as a protocol-cell, privacy-by-projection, statically-classified
           I-confluent fragment).

A `JointTurn` is *one* atomic step; real agent coordination — negotiation, auction,
commit-reveal vote, request→subtasks→aggregate→return workflow — is a **stateful,
multi-round, multi-party** interaction, i.e. a structured *composition of JointTurns
over time*. We model it as a **multiparty session type** (MPST):

  * a **global type `G`** (a choreography) describes the whole protocol — who talks to
    whom, in what order, with what branching/recursion (Honda–Yoshida–Carbone, JACM
    2016; Carbone–Montesi choreographic programming);
  * **projection** `G ↾ p` (`project G p`) gives each role its **local/endpoint type**
    — its own view of the protocol;
  * a well-formed (projectable) `G` enjoys **progress + deadlock-freedom by design**
    (the MPST/EPP fidelity guarantee) — the multi-party-multi-turn safety property
    (Law 2, *ordering*).

Reified as a cell (`dregg2 §6`, [F]): a coordination is a **protocol-cell** whose
`CellProgram` *is* `G` — its admissibility predicate = "is this the next legal action
under `G`," its state = messages-so-far; participant cells advance it via JointTurns,
the await family connecting steps (a "receive" *is* a zkpromise awaiting the matching
"send"). A coordination is therefore **a cell coordinating cells** — the cell concept
recursing, no new top-level primitive. The protocol-cell's coalgebra is exactly a
`Boundary.TurnCoalg`, so this module **embeds `G` (resp. `G ↾ p`) into the final
coalgebra `νF`** of `Boundary` (`study-choreography` claim #3: a local session type IS
a communicating automaton / Moore coalgebra — grounded in `coalgebraic-semantics-silva`).

Three judgements, kept ORTHOGONAL (`study-choreography` claim #1, **[REFUTED]** the
linearity⇒I-confluence conflation):
  * **Law 1 (conservation / linearity)** — `Core` / `Resource`;
  * **Law 2 (ordering / session)** — THIS module's `project`/projectability;
  * **the third judgement (I-confluence)** — `Confluence.IConfluent`, a BEC-style
    invariant-confluence analysis over a step's write-set × cell-state-lattice, **NOT**
    detected by the session type. We import it and link each protocol step's
    *cross-group runnability* to it (`iconfluent_fragment_crossgroup_free`): a step
    whose effect is I-confluent runs cross-group, partition-tolerant, with no atomic
    commit; a coupled (Σ=0 settlement) step must block (`dregg2 §6`, §7-(1)).

Privacy-by-projection (`dregg2 §6`, [F]): party `p` sees only `project G p`; the
global choreography is graph-hidden by the protocol structure itself.

Style: spec-first, grind up — projection/data is DEFINED (computable where feasible);
the soundness/fidelity/deadlock-freedom THEOREMS are stated as faithful Props with
`sorry` bodies (each `sorry` = a real obligation; many are `study-choreography`'s
CONFIRMED-OPEN problems — flagged in the relevant docstrings). The branching `merge`
in projection is genuinely partial (classical MPST projection is **sound but
incomplete**, claim #2) and is left abstract / partial on purpose.

Naming note: `src`/`dst` are used for the sender/receiver roles of a communication;
the obvious word `to` is a Lean reserved token (so is `Sort` — payload sorts are
named `Payload`).

/-! ## Roles, labels, and the global type `G` -/

/-- A protocol **role** (endpoint identity / participant). Abstract — `Nat` here; in
the real system a role resolves to a participant *cell* (the protocol-cell coordinates
cells, so a role is "which cell plays this part"). -/
abbrev Role := Nat

/-- A **branch label** (the `&`/`⊕` selector — which alternative was chosen). -/
abbrev Label := Nat

/-- A **payload sort** carried by a communication (the message type). Abstract.
(Named `Payload` because `Sort` is the reserved universe keyword.) -/
abbrev Payload := Nat

/-- A **recursion variable** name (for `μ`-recursive protocols). -/
abbrev TyVar := Nat

/-- **`GlobalType` — the choreography `G`** (Honda–Yoshida–Carbone): the whole
protocol from a god's-eye view. Constructors:

  * `comm src dst s cont` — `src → dst : ⟨s⟩ . cont`: role `src` sends a value of
    sort `s` to role `dst`, then the protocol continues as `cont` (the binary
    interaction MPST sequences; an atomic N-ary JointTurn step is a dregg2 *extension*,
    `study-choreography` claim #4, CONFIRMED-OPEN);
  * `choice src dst branches` — `src → dst : { ℓᵢ . Gᵢ }`: `src` *selects* a labelled
    branch and `dst` *offers* the set; the choreographic branching point;
  * `mu X G` / `var X` — `μX.G` recursion and its variable (recursive/looping
    protocols); named `mu` because `rec` is a reserved constructor name (clashes with
    the auto-generated recursor `GlobalType.rec`);
  * `done` — `end`: the completed protocol. -/

/-- **`LocalType` — an endpoint type** `G ↾ p` (one role's view). Constructors mirror
`GlobalType` but are *directed* — a `comm` splits into the sender's `send` and the
receiver's `recv`; a `choice` splits into the active role's `select` and the passive
role's `offer`:

  * `send dst s cont` — `!⟨s⟩ dst . cont`: output a value to `dst`;
  * `recv src s cont` — `?⟨s⟩ src . cont`: input a value from `src`;
  * `select dst branches` — `dst ⊕ { ℓᵢ . Lᵢ }`: internal choice (we pick a label);
  * `offer src branches` — `src & { ℓᵢ . Lᵢ }`: external choice (we accept any label);
  * `mu X L` / `var X` — endpoint recursion (`mu`, not `rec`, per the recursor clash);
  * `done` — `end` (this role is finished / not involved). -/

in `select`/`offer`, so we discharge it by structural recursion through a Boolean
equality test `beq` (proved correct against `=` by a structural `beq_iff`), then read off
the `Decidable` instance from that correctness lemma. This makes `mergeLocal`'s `if
L₁ = L₂` computable. -/

/-! ## Projection `G ↾ p`

The heart of MPST. `project G p` computes role `p`'s endpoint type. It is **partial in
the branching case** by nature: when `p` is *not* the role driving a `choice`, its
continuations across the branches must agree up to a **merge** operator `⊔ₗ`, and the
classical merge is partial — projection is **sound but incomplete** (`study-choreography`
claim #2, CONFIRMED). We define the directed comm/recursion cases computably and route
branching through an abstract, deliberately-partial `mergeLocal`. -/

/-- **`mergeLocal` — the MPST branch-merge `⊔ₗ`.** Reconciles a non-active role's
continuations across the branches of a `choice` it neither selects nor offers. The
classical operator is *partial* (defined only on "mergeable" continuations — e.g.
identical, or differing only in disjoint `offer` labels), which is the source of MPST
projection's incompleteness. Modelled as `Option`. We commit to the **simplest SOUND classical merge**: two
continuations are mergeable iff they are *identical* (`L₁ = L₂ ⇒ some L₁`, else `none`).
This is the conservative core of the classical MPST merge (the standard full-merge that
unions disjoint `offer` branches is a strict, sound superset; restricting to identity
keeps soundness — projection still implements the global protocol — at the cost of
rejecting some projectable choreographies, i.e. the CONFIRMED incompleteness of claim
#2). `DecidableEq LocalType` (derived above) makes this computable. -/
def mergeLocal : LocalType → LocalType → Option LocalType :=
  fun L₁ L₂ => if L₁ = L₂ then some L₁ else none

/- **`project G p` = `G ↾ p` — projection of the choreography onto an endpoint** (with
its mutual branch helpers). Directed split:
  * `comm a b s k`: if `p = a` ⇒ `send b s (k↾p)`; if `p = b` ⇒ `recv a s (k↾p)`;
    else `p` is uninvolved in this message ⇒ skip to `k↾p`.
  * `choice a b bs`: if `p = a` ⇒ `select b (bs↾p)`; if `p = b` ⇒ `offer a (bs↾p)`;
    else `p` must reconcile the branches via `mergeLocal` (`projectBranches`) — the
    partial case. We default a failed/absent merge to `done` so `project` is TOTAL as a
    function (the *partiality* lives, honestly, in `mergeLocal` returning `none`); a real
    implementation surfaces "not projectable" as a `Projectable` failure.
  * `mu X g` / `var X` / `done`: structural.
`projectMap`/`projectBranches` recurse on the branch list so the structural-recursion
checker sees each `g` as a subterm of the `choice`. Fully computable now that
`mergeLocal` is concrete (the identity merge, decidable via `DecidableEq LocalType`). -/

the `Boundary.TurnCoalg` whose `step` IS `G`'s transition: its carrier ranges over the
*residual* global types (protocol-so-far → protocol-remaining), the observation
component (`Obs`) exposes the public protocol head, the admissible-turn component
(`AdmissibleTurn`) is "play the next legal action of `G`," and `residual` decodes a
carrier-state back to the global type it represents (the witness that `coalg.step` IS
`G`'s transition — a Moore coalgebra of `G`). -/

/-! ## Duality and progress (the content of fidelity / deadlock-freedom)

The load-bearing fact projection guarantees is **duality**: the sender's projected head
of a `comm a b` is a `send` to `b` and the receiver's is the dual `recv` from `a`. A
configuration is **stuck** when a role is blocked on an input/external-choice with no
matching output anywhere — deadlock-freedom-by-design is exactly the absence of stuck,
non-`done` reachable configurations. We state these structurally so the theorems below
are genuine (not `⟨_, rfl⟩`-trivial). -/

or external choice) — the only states from which a system can deadlock. -/

obligation). -/
def LocalType.terminated : LocalType → Bool
  | LocalType.done => true
  | _              => false

/-- **`Dual L₁ L₂`** — the two endpoints can synchronise *now*: a `send dst s` faces a
`recv src s` of the matching sort (and dually). This is the per-step compatibility MPST
projection must produce; the existence of a dual partner for every `waiting` role is
exactly progress. -/

/-! ## Theorems — fidelity, deadlock-freedom, the I-confluent fragment, privacy -/

/-- **`projection_sound` — MPST fidelity / Endpoint-Projection soundness.** Running the
projected endpoints `{ G ↾ p | p ∈ roles G }` *in parallel* realizes exactly the global
choreography `G`: the trace of the composed endpoints equals the traces of `G` (no extra
or missing communications). This is the standard MPST fidelity theorem (Honda–Yoshida–
Carbone) and Carbone–Montesi's EPP soundness — "the local types faithfully implement the
global protocol."

Here stated via its crispest checkable content — **head-duality at a communication**:
for a protocol-cell running `comm a b s k` (with `a ≠ b`), the sender's projection is a
`send` and the receiver's is the *dual* `recv` (`Dual`), i.e. the two endpoints
synchronise on exactly the message `G` prescribes. (The full statement is a bisimulation
of the parallel-composed projections to `pc.coalg` at `pc.start`, in `Boundary.IsBisim`'s
sense — the realization the discharge must produce.) `sorry`. -/

/-- **`deadlock_freedom_by_design` — Carbone–Montesi.** A well-formed (projectable)
global type yields a **deadlock-free** endpoint system: the parallel composition of the
projections never reaches a stuck non-`done` configuration — every non-terminated state
has an enabled communication (progress), and dual endpoints always find their partner
(no orphan send/receive). This is *deadlock-freedom by construction* — the defining
guarantee of choreographic programming: you cannot write a deadlocking choreography,
because every send in `G` has its matching receive *in `G`*, preserved by projection.

Stated as **progress**: every role whose projection is `waiting` (blocked on a
`recv`/`offer`) has a co-participant whose projection is a matching `Dual` partner — so
no role is stuck without a partner. (The faithful formal statement quantifies over all
reachable configurations of the composed LTS; here over the initial projections, which
is where projectability has to make duality hold.) `sorry`. -/

/-- **`StepEffect` — the per-protocol-step effect** whose I-confluence the third
judgement classifies. A choreography step (one `comm`/`choice` action, as it lands in
the participant cells) induces an update on the touched cells' merge-state `S`; whether
that update is I-confluent (`Confluence.IConfluent` over the cell-state lattice) decides
cross-group runnability. Abstractly, a step is the cell invariant its writes must
preserve. -/

free; the coupled fragment must block.** `dregg2 §6` + §7-(1), corrected by
`study-choreography` claim #1 (**[REFUTED]** the linearity⇒I-confluence conflation): the
classifier is **NOT** the session type — it is `Confluence.IConfluent` over the step's
write-set × cell-state-lattice (a third, independent judgement). The two-sided claim:

  * **I-confluent step** (commutative/monotone — append a commitment, add to a CRDT set,
    post an intent, an independent grant): if `Confluence.IConfluent step.inv`, the step
    needs **no cross-group coordination** — it runs partition-tolerant, no atomic commit
    (`Confluence.Tier1Eligible`, the tier-1 gate). Hence a choreography whose steps are
    ALL I-confluent runs fully cross-group free.
  * **Coupled step** (an atomic Σ=0 settlement): if `¬ Confluence.IConfluent step.inv`,
    the step is the blocking atomic JointTurn — cross-group blocks under partition

Stated as the biconditional linking the protocol step's cross-group-freedom (its tier-1
eligibility) to `Confluence.IConfluent`. `sorry`. (`study-choreography` claim #5: a
choreography that statically partitions these fragments over Byzantine parties is
CONFIRMED-OPEN / likely NEW — this theorem names that formal object.) -/

§6`, the "graph" privacy tier (`study-choreography` claim #6, CONFIRMED-OPEN): a
participant `p` learns only `project G p`; the global choreography `G` and co-parties'
moves are graph-hidden by the protocol structure itself. Non-participants (roles ∉
`roles G`) learn nothing — their projection is `done`.

Stated as the checkable information-flow consequence: an uninvolved role projects to
`done` (sees nothing). The full property is "a role's knowledge is a function of
`project G p` ALONE" (two global types with the same projection at `p` are
indistinguishable to `p`); and the full *cryptographic* conformance ("`p` ZK-proves its
move is admissible under a *committed* `G` without revealing `G`") is the CONFIRMED-OPEN
gap (claim #6) — the ZK substrate exists (Kachina/UC-ZK/commitment-nullifier) but its
composition with MPST does not. `sorry`. -/

  -- OPEN: FALSE as stated for OPEN (un-`mu`-bound) recursion variables — needs a
  -- closedness/well-formedness hypothesis the signature lacks (rule #1: cannot add it).
  -- With `mergeLocal` now concrete, the `comm`/`choice`/`done` cases DO reduce to `done`
  -- (the passive-role ≥2-branch `choice` collapses: `mergeLocal (project g p) l` with
  -- `project g p = l = done` is `if done = done then some done else none = some done`,
  -- so `(projectBranches …).getD done = done`). The genuine obstruction is the two
  -- *recursion* constructors:
  --   • `project (var X) p = LocalType.var X` and `roles (var X) = []`, so for `G = var 0`
  --     EVERY `p` satisfies `p ∉ roles G` yet `project G p = var 0 ≠ done` — a kernel-
  --     checked counterexample (`#5 ∉ roles (var 0)` but `project (var 0) 5 = var 0`);
  --   • `project (mu X body) p = LocalType.mu X (project body p)`, never `done`, even
  --     when `project body p = done` (`mu` is retained structurally for the residual LTS).
  -- These are false ONLY because the statement omits "`G` closed / `Projectable`"; under
  -- a closedness hypothesis (no free `var`, and `mu` peeled to a guarded action) the
  -- result holds. Closing it as stated would require weakening the conclusion or adding a
  -- hypothesis — both forbidden. The `mergeLocal`-blocked half is now discharged; the
  -- recursion half is the open obligation.
