# Dregg2.Finality — the SECOND judgement (ordering / canonicity / consensus).

`dregg2.md §2.2` (Law 2: "the pluggable finality tier `[G]`") states that canonicity
— *which valid history is THE history* — is **not** carried inside any proof. It is a
per-cell **pluggable finality tier** layered on top of ONE underlying DAG: a
join-semilattice CvRDT, proven a Merkle-CRDT (`discoveries §4`). `Confluence.lean`
already encodes only this judgement's *I-confluence side-condition* (the static gate
deciding tier-1 eligibility). THIS module encodes the **canonicity law itself**: the
tier lattice, the `τ_unified` selector, and the cross-tier commit/no-downgrade laws.

The four-tier ladder (the dregg2 §2.2 table — synchrony / partition behaviour in the
constructor docs):
  1. **Causal-only / CRDT** — add block, causal order, n≥1, no synchrony assumption,
     NEVER blocks (phones over BLE keep working).
  2. **Ack-threshold** — k-of-m acks, no leader, small n, no synchrony for safety,
     degrades to tier 1 under partition.
  3. **Cordial-Miners τ-BFT** — DAG waves + leader + 3-step ratify, known committee Π
     with n≥3, GST/asynchronous, STALLS under partition, resumes after GST.
  4. **Constitutional** — τ-BFT + self-amending `(P, σ, Δ)`, known parties + PKI,
     partial-synchrony, stalls plus a deadline.

Literature anchors (this round's corpus): blocklace / **Cordial Miners** (the leaderful
DAG BFT giving tier 3); **Merkle-CRDT** join-semilattice DAG (the single substrate);
the constitutional / self-amending-governance line (tier 4). The `½(n+f)` quorum that a
naive design hardcodes is lifted into per-group **config** here (`Config.threshold`), and
the four "globalism seams" the design rejects (single global total order; GST as a
precondition for ANY progress; a fixed σ-quorum forbidding n=1; a synchronized
wall-clock deadline) are deliberately NOT baked into the lattice — tiers 1–2 make
progress with no synchrony and n=1.

Spec-first, grind up: data that is cheap is defined (`Tier`, `rank`, the order
instances, `crossTierJoin`); the genuine distributed-agreement / classifier obligations
are honest `Prop`s with `sorry` bodies. Each `sorry` is a real obligation.

  synchrony for *safety*; under partition it **degrades to tier 1** rather than
  stalling. -/
  | ackThreshold
  /-- **Tier 3 — Cordial-Miners τ-BFT.** Blocklace DAG waves + a per-wave leader + a
  3-step ratification; a known committee Π with n ≥ 3; GST / asynchronous network; it
  **stalls** during a partition and **resumes after GST**. -/

  /-- **Tier 4 — Constitutional.** τ-BFT plus a self-amending constitution `(P, σ, Δ)`;

`h` has met `H`'s tier's agreement condition — e.g. tier-1 "is a causal extension",
tier-2 "k-of-m acks", tier-3/4 "a τ-BFT quorum ratified it". The `½(n+f)` threshold is

hardcodes is lifted here: `n` participants, `f` tolerated faults, `threshold` the

  means a `FinalityRule` value IS, by definition, a rule whose commits are canonical.
  (Statement-repair: the earlier version left `committed`/`canonical` unlinked, so
  `commit_at_join_of_tiers` was unprovable.) -/

We model it as: a per-group tier assignment `groupTier`, plus a `ruleOf` building the
concrete rule for a tier under the config. `tau_unified G` is the rule `τ` runs for `G`.

a STATIC error (`balance≥0` cannot be tier-1; hash-keyed nullifier uniqueness can). This

the value's currently-finalized `Tier`; a step is a (re-)finalization event, admissible

no-downgrade safety property lives over: the *commit history* of one value, where each
event may only keep or strengthen its finality. The abstract `committed`/`canonical`
predicates of a `FinalityRule` cannot express this — it is a constraint on the sequence

"un-finalized" and tier-3/4 values from silent weakening. Proved by lifting the per-step

/-! ## Conservation (Law 1) is tier-independent (§2.2 closing clause).

The two judgements are orthogonal: Law 1 (conservation) is a balance on the resource
MEASURE; Law 2 (ordering/finality) is a per-cell tier. The closing clause of §2.2 — "the
finality tier only prunes the order search; it neither creates nor destroys resource" —
is the statement that *re-annotating a cell at a different tier does not change the
conservation verdict*. We make this honest (not `True`) by exhibiting the conservation
balance as a predicate that takes a `Tier` argument it provably DISCARDS, and proving the
verdict agrees across two genuinely-distinct tiers. The content lives in: (a) the balance
predicate is `Core.conservation_step`'s equality, which mentions no `Tier`; (b) the
cross-tier agreement below quantifies over distinct tiers and proves equality of verdicts.
-/

/-- **The tier-annotated conservation balance.** The Law-1 balance verdict for a turn
`f : Core.Turn A B` under measure `cons`, carrying — for the sake of the orthogonality
statement — the finality `Tier` the cell is annotated at. The verdict is
`count A + minted = count B + burned` (`Core`'s balance), and the `Tier` argument is
DISCARDED: that discarding is precisely "the tier does not enter the conservation
measure". -/
def conservedAtTier {M : Type u} [AddCommMonoid M]
    (cons : Core.Conservation M) (_t : Tier) {A B : Core.Cell} (f : Core.Turn A B) : Prop :=
  cons.count A + cons.minted f.tag = cons.count B + cons.burned f.tag

/-- **The tier-independent verdict is the genuine Law-1 balance (anchoring non-vacuity).**
At every tier, `conservedAtTier` holds for an arbitrary turn — because it unfolds to
`Core.conservation_step`'s balance, which `Core` discharges as Law 1. This ties the
cross-tier statement to real conservation content (so it is not agreement between two
vacuous predicates): the shared verdict is exactly the resource-balance law. -/
theorem conservedAtTier_holds {M : Type u} [AddCommMonoid M]

    (t : Tier) {A B : Core.Cell} (f : Core.Turn A B) :
    conservedAtTier cons t f := by
  unfold conservedAtTier
  exact Core.conservation_step cons f

/-- **Conservation is tier-independent (§2.2 closing clause) — the REAL tier-erasure law.**
For ANY two finality tiers `t₁ t₂` (in particular two *distinct* tiers — e.g. `causal` vs
`constitutional`), the conservation balance *predicate* of a turn is the **same proposition**:
`conservedAtTier t₁ f = conservedAtTier t₂ f`, proved by `rfl`. This is genuine independence,
not "both verdicts happen to be true" — the two sides are *definitionally identical* because the
`Tier` argument is discarded by the measure (`conservedAtTier` does not mention `_t`). Re-tagging
the cell's finality tier cannot change the conservation verdict because the tier never enters it.
Law 1 (conservation) and Law 2 (ordering/tier) are thereby orthogonal — mirroring §2.3's
I-confluence being orthogonal to both. (Earlier this was stated as an `↔` discharged by
`iff_of_true`, which would have held even for a tier-*dependent* verdict as long as both sides were
true; the equality-by-`rfl` form is the honest content.) -/

  rfl

/-- The `↔` corollary (so downstream callers expecting the biconditional still resolve), now a
*consequence* of the genuine equality rather than a both-sides-true coincidence. -/
