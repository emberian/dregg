# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomQueryFloor` — a floor that is **PROVED**, because its adversary class is
**QUERY-BOUNDED** rather than unrestricted.

## The situation this file answers (all of it mechanized, in `FloorGames`)

`FloorGames.hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` proves, for EVERY game `G`:

    Hard G (fun _ => True)  ↔  Negl (solvableFrac G)

At the unrestricted adversary class a game floor IS the probabilistic existence floor, because
`FloorGames.choiceAdv` — `Classical.choice`, reading the instance and picking a winning answer — is
a perfectly good `Adversary`. So every floor is FALSE at deployed parameters (pigeonhole), and
`Eff := ⊥` is vacuous (`hard_bot_vacuous`). `FloorGames` §8 names the residual: **`Eff` is a
parameter with no content, because the tree has no cost model.** `solvableIsAFiniteSearch` sharpens
it — brute force IS computable; what disqualifies it is COST, and `Fintype` cannot say `2^128`.

## What this file does: it gives `Eff` content, WITHOUT a cost model

The escape is not a complexity class. It is **the random oracle**.

An `Adversary G` is `run : ∀ l, G.Inst l → G.Ans l` — an arbitrary function OF THE WHOLE INSTANCE.
When the instance is an ORACLE (a uniformly sampled function `H : D l → R l`), that type lets the
adversary read all of `H` for free, and `choiceAdv` does exactly that. A real attacker cannot. It
learns `H` only by CALLING it, and each call is one unit of work.

`RomOracle.OracleComp` makes that a TYPE: a decision tree that branches only on answers it asked
for, with `RomOracle.QueryBounded Q M` bounding the calls along every path. `RomOracle.OracleComp.
eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried` is the load-bearing fact — two oracles agreeing on what `M` queried
are indistinguishable to `M`. `RomEff F Q` (§4) is then a genuine `Eff : Adversary G → Prop`: the
adversaries that FACTOR THROUGH a `Q`-query tree.

⚑ **This is a resource bound with no complexity theory in it.** `QueryBounded` is a property of the
adversary's SYNTAX, and the determination theorem converts that syntax into a constraint on its
BEHAVIOUR. Nothing here counts steps, no machine model appears, and no computational assumption is
made. Contrast `ConcreteSecurity.StepBound.PPT`, which is already in the tree: it is
`PolyBoundedNat` applied to a bare `steps : ℕ → ℕ` that is attached to no adversary and constrains
no behaviour — a name for a number sequence. It cannot serve as an `Eff`, and nothing uses it as one.

## §5 — the bound, and it is INFORMATION-THEORETIC

`birthday_cond` proves, by induction on the query tree over `RomCounting`'s lazy-sampling-as-counting
lemmas:

    condProb (cyl S σ) (collWin M)  ≤  (Q * S.card + Q * Q + 1) / |R|

At `S = ∅` that is `birthday_bound`: **a `Q`-query adversary finds a collision in a random oracle
with probability at most `(Q² + 1)/|R|`.** The classic birthday bound. There is no assumption under
it — no MSIS, no MLWE, no "hash is collision resistant". It is a counting fact about the function
space `D → R`, and the whole of its content is `RomCounting.condProb_fresh_eq`: *what the adversary
has not queried, it does not know.*

## §6–§7 — BOTH ESCAPES, PROVED

  * **The class is not `⊤` in disguise.** `romCollision_hard`: at a `λ`-growing range
    (`|R l| = 2^l`) and a polynomially-bounded budget, `Hard (romCollisionGame F) (RomEff F Q)` is
    TRUE. `romCollision_top_false`: at the SAME game, `Hard _ ⊤` is FALSE — by the SAME pigeonhole
    that refutes `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` (`FloorGames.collisionResistant_false_of_
    compressing`). `romEff_not_iff_solvableFrac_negl` states the consequence directly: **the
    collapse `↔` FAILS for `RomEff`.** `choiceAdv_not_romEff` names the reason — `Classical.choice`'s
    adversary is PROVED not to be in the class. It cannot query; it would have to already know.
  * **The class is not `⊥` in disguise.** `twoPointAdv_in_romEff` exhibits a member that genuinely
    uses its queries, and `twoPointAdv_gameAdv_eq` computes its advantage EXACTLY: `1/|R l|`,
    which `twoPointAdv_gameAdv_pos` shows is nonzero. A real adversary, really in the class, really
    winning sometimes.

⚑ **So one floor in this tree is now PROVED rather than assumed**, and the honest scope is exactly
that: this route works for HASH-BASED soundness (a random oracle), and for NOTHING ELSE. MSIS and
MLWE remain assumptions — correctly, nobody proves them — and their `Eff` residual stands as
`FloorGames` §8 states it.

## The named residual, not closed here

`RomEff`'s budget is a QUERY count, not a running time. A `Q`-query adversary may do unbounded work
BETWEEN queries (the continuations `k : R → OracleComp ..` are arbitrary functions, and may be
`Classical.choice`). That is sound for hash-based bounds — the classic ROM bounds are exactly of
this shape, and the whole point is that they hold against a computationally UNBOUNDED, query-bounded
adversary — but it is not a cost model, and it does not restrict a lattice adversary at all, which
makes no oracle calls. The general PPT `Eff` remains open, and it remains a parameter.

⚑ **A CORRECTION TO `FloorGames` §8, which says Mathlib has "no `PPT`, no machine model".** It has
both. `Mathlib.Computability.TuringMachine.Computable` defines
`Turing.TM2ComputableInPolyTime ea eb f` — a bundled TM2 machine, tape-alphabet equivalences, a
`time : Polynomial ℕ`, and a proof the machine outputs `f` within `time.eval (ea a).length` steps.
§8's operative qualifier — "over an ARBITRARY CARRIER" — is what survives, and it is the whole
story. Three facts about that definition, each checked against the pinned revision:

  1. **It is a DEEP EMBEDDING.** `Eff A` would have to exhibit a Turing machine and ENCODINGS
     `ea : Inst l → List αΓ`, `eb : Ans l → List βΓ` into finite tape alphabets. A `Game`'s `Inst`
     and `Ans` are arbitrary `ℕ → Type` with no encoding, so there is nothing to hand it.
  2. **Its only witness is the identity.** `idComputableInPolyTime` is the sole inhabitant; no
     nontrivial function in Mathlib is proved polynomial-time computable.
  3. **Composition is `proof_wanted`.** `TM2ComputableInPolyTime.comp` is stated and NOT proved.
     Every cryptographic reduction composes adversaries, so a PPT `Eff` built on this could not
     transport through a single reduction.

That is the honest measure of what a general PPT `Eff` would cost, taken from the state of the only
Lean machine model there is. `QueryBounded` needs none of it: no encoding, no machine, and no
composition theorem, because it is a property of the adversary's own syntax.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no

/-! ## §3 — ⚑ THE BIRTHDAY BOUND, by induction on the query tree.

The invariant is the whole argument: `σ` records what the adversary has ALREADY LEARNED, and it is
maintained COLLISION-FREE — because the moment two learned answers collide the adversary has won,
and the induction pays for that branch at full price (`condProb_le_one`). A fresh query lands in the
already-learned image with probability at most `|S|/|R|`, which is what accumulates to `Q²/|R|`. -/

/-- **⚑ THE CONDITIONAL BIRTHDAY BOUND.** A `Q`-query computation, run against an oracle already
pinned to a collision-free `σ` on `S`, outputs a collision with probability at most
`(Q·|S| + Q² + 1)/|R|`.

The three sources of the bound, visible in the proof: the `+1` is the final guess (an unqueried pair
collides with probability `1/|R|`, §2); the `Q·|S|` is the chance a fresh query lands on an
already-known answer; the `Q²` accumulates that as `|S|` grows by one per query.

NOTHING IS ASSUMED. This is a counting statement about the finite function space `D → R`. -/

oracle is a uniformly sampled function `D l → R l`; it IS the instance of the game below. No hash
function is named, and none is needed — in the random oracle model the sampled function is the
object. -/
structure RomFamily where
  /-- The oracle's domain at parameter `l` — what can be hashed. -/
  D : ℕ → Type
  /-- The oracle's range at parameter `l` — the digest space. -/
  R : ℕ → Type
  /-- The domain is finite. -/
  dFin : ∀ l, Fintype (D l)
  /-- Decidable equality on the domain (the win event checks `x ≠ y`). -/
  dDec : ∀ l, DecidableEq (D l)
  /-- The domain is inhabited. -/
  dNe : ∀ l, Nonempty (D l)
  /-- The range is finite (the oracle space `D l → R l` must be a finite outcome space). -/
  rFin : ∀ l, Fintype (R l)
  /-- Decidable equality on the range (the win event checks the digests agree). -/
  rDec : ∀ l, DecidableEq (R l)
  /-- The range is inhabited. -/
  rNe : ∀ l, Nonempty (R l)

/-- **THE ROM COLLISION GAME.** The instance is THE ORACLE — a uniformly sampled `H : D l → R l`.
The adversary outputs a pair, and WINS iff that pair is a genuine collision of `H`.

⚑ Note what the `Game` schema does to an oracle: `Adversary G` is `∀ l, (D l → R l) → (D l × D l)`,
a function that receives the WHOLE function `H`. That type is the disease — it hands the adversary
the oracle's entire truth table for free. §4's `RomEff` is the cure, and it is a restriction on that
same `Adversary` type, so this game plugs into `FloorGames.Hard` unchanged. -/

`RomEff F Q A` says: `A` FACTORS THROUGH a query tree that makes at most `Q l` oracle calls. It is a
predicate on the SAME `Adversary (romCollisionGame F)` type `FloorGames.Hard` quantifies over, so
`Hard (romCollisionGame F) (RomEff F Q)` is the tree's existing floor schema at a class with real
content.

⚑ It is neither pole, and both facts are PROVED below, not asserted: not `⊤`
(`choiceAdv_not_romEff` — `Classical.choice`'s adversary is excluded, because it would have to know
answers it never asked for), and not `⊥` (`twoPointAdv_in_romEff`, which has advantage exactly
`1/|R l| > 0`). -/

unrestricted floor. -/

At a `λ`-growing digest space (`|R l| = 2^l`, the deployed shape of a hash) and a polynomially
bounded query budget, EVERY query-bounded adversary's collision advantage is negligible.

⚑ Compare what this replaces. `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant F` is `HashCRHardQuant F ⊤`
(`FloorGames.collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top`) and is FALSE at a compressing family
(`FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing`). `MSISHardQuant F Eff` is a floor whose `Eff`
has no content. THIS statement has a hypothesis-free adversary class, a proved bound
(`birthday_bound`), and no cryptographic assumption anywhere under it. The `Negl` comes from
`negl_two_pow` — the digest space outruns the budget.

The two hypotheses are exactly the deployed facts and nothing more: the digest is `λ` bits wide, and
the attacker makes polynomially many calls. -/

/-- **⚑⚑⚑ `Classical.choice`'S ADVERSARY IS NOT IN THE CLASS — proved.**

This is the load-bearing exclusion, and the reason the whole approach works. `FloorGames.choiceAdv`
reads the oracle's entire truth table and returns a collision; its advantage is `solvableFrac`, the
constant `1` at a compressing family. If it were query-bounded, `romCollision_hard` would make `1`
negligible.

⚑ The INFORMATIONAL content, which is what makes this different from a definitional dodge: a query
tree's output is a function of the answers it received (`RomOracle.OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_
on_queried`) and of nothing else. `choiceAdv` would have to KNOW where the collision is without
asking. In the random oracle model there is nowhere to know it from. -/

  2. the class is **INHABITED** by an adversary that really queries and really wins — its advantage

  3. the unrestricted floor **at the same game** is **FALSE** (`binaryRom_top_false`).
