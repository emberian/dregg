# Dregg2.Exec.TurnExecutorFull — WIDENING the replacement executor to the FULL dregg1 op-set.

`Exec/TurnExecutor.lean`'s `execTurn` runs dregg1's call-forest of catalog-typed *balance/effect*
`Action`s as an all-or-nothing transaction, step-complete by construction (`execTurn_attests`: the
four `StepInv` conjuncts over the whole multi-`Action` turn). But dregg1's turn-executor does MORE
than balance/effect moves: it also runs **authority ops** (grant/revoke caps — the Granovetter
delegate / target-revoke) and **supply ops** (mint/burn — the only ops that legitimately move the
conserved total). For the replacement to SUBSUME every dregg1 turn kind, it must cover those too.

This module widens the executor. We introduce a single sum

  `FullAction = balance (a `TurnExecutor.Action`)
              | delegate / revoke  (an AUTHORITY turn, via `AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate` /
                                    `recKRevokeTarget`)
              | mint / burn        (a SUPPLY turn, the record-cell refinement of
                                    `Generators.execMint` / `execBurn` over the `balance` FIELD)`

and one executor `execFull : RecChainedState → FullAction → Option RecChainedState`, all over the
SAME content-addressed record world (`RecChainedState` / `recTotal` / `balOf`) that `TurnExecutor`
and `AuthTurn` already share — so the widening is genuinely ONE executor, not three. Each kind is
all-or-nothing (fail-closed gates, `Option`-monad). A whole turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as
a transaction (`execFullTurn`), exactly `execTurn`'s discipline lifted to the wider op-set.

We then PROVE that EVERY kind attests its `StepInv` obligations, packaged as `fullActionInv`:

  * **balance/effect** — Conservation (the `balance` field) ∧ Authority ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance,
    delegated VERBATIM to `recCexec_attests` (the `TurnExecutor` spine, one op);
  * **authority (delegate/revoke)** — the FRAME-FIX: `recTotal` is UNCHANGED (conservation trivially
    preserved — `recKDelegate_frame` / `recKRevokeTarget_frame`), and the cap graph is EDITED per
    `AuthTurn` (`recKDelegate_execGraph` / `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` = `Spec.addEdge`/`removeEdge`
    = `Introduce`/`Revoke` `result`); a delegation is moreover AUTHORIZED (`recKDelegate_grounds`:
    the delegator holds the source edge — "only connectivity begets connectivity");
  * **mint/burn** — the supply MOVES by exactly `±amt` (`recMint_delta` / `recBurn_delta`, the
    record-cell refinement of `Generators.mint_delta`/`burn_delta`) with the
    Generative/Annihilative DISCLOSURE obligation discharged off `CatalogEffects`
    (`g_bridgeMint`/`a_burn` color ⇒ `is_disclosed_non_conservation`), and mint/burn are AUTHORIZED
    (the privileged `mintAuthorizedB` gate — a cell cannot coin its own supply).

The headline `execFull_attests` bundles these per-kind: every committed `FullAction` attests the
relevant `StepInv` content for its kind, so the replacement executor is **step-complete across EVERY
dregg1 turn kind** — not just balance/effect. (`fullActionInv` is never weakened: each kind carries
exactly its sound obligations, with conservation tracked EXACTLY — `0` for balance/authority, `±amt`
for mint/burn — via the `ledgerDelta` book-keeping, the executable shadow of dregg1's per-domain
`excess`.)

Discipline (REORIENT §6): no `axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`. `#assert_axioms` on every
keystone. Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Reuses `TurnExecutor`/`AuthTurn`/`Generators`/
`CatalogEffects`/`RecordKernel`; edits none. Verified standalone:

/-! ## §1 — Record-cell MINT/BURN: the supply generators over the `balance` FIELD.

`Exec/Generators.lean` proves `execMint`/`execBurn` over the *scalar* `KernelState` (`bal : CellId →
ℤ`, measure `total`). The full executor lives in the *record* world (`RecordKernelState`, measure
`recTotal` over the `balance` field). So we re-found the two supply generators here over the record
cell — the EXACT analog of `Generators` but writing the named `balance` field via `setBalance` —
reusing `Generators.mintAuthorizedB` (the privileged `node`/`control` gate; bare ownership is NOT
enough to coin supply) and `Kernel.sum_indicator` (the single-point-sum technique). -/

/-- Credit cell `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` (record-cell mint write). Touches only `cell`'s
record (and only its `balance` field — every other field of the content-addressed record survives,
by `setBalance`); every other cell is untouched. -/

/-! ## §2 — The DISCLOSURE obligation for mint/burn (the Generative/Annihilative gate).

A supply move legitimately breaks `Σδ = 0`, but its delta is FORCED into the receipt — the
`is_disclosed_non_conservation` obligation `CatalogEffects` proves of the Generative
(`bridgeMint`/mint) and Annihilative (`burn`) colors. We tie each record-cell supply op to its
catalog color so the disclosure obligation is discharged for the executable op, not just abstractly.

def burnEffect : EffectKind := .burn

non-conservation obligation: its supply delta must be revealed in the receipt. Discharged off
`CatalogEffects.generative_discloses` + `g_bridgeMint`. -/

amount must be revealed. Discharged off `CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses` + `a_burn`. -/

  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses burnEffect Dregg2.CatalogEffects.a_burn

the delta disclosed — the supply ops are exactly the non-`Paired` half of the catalog. PROVED. -/
theorem mint_regime_disclosed : effectObligation mintEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl
theorem burn_regime_disclosed : effectObligation burnEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl

/-! ## §3 — Authority turns lifted to `RecChainedState` (the chained delegate / revoke).

`AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate`/`recKRevokeTarget` edit `RecordKernelState.caps`. To run them inside the
unified chained executor we lift each onto `RecChainedState`, threading the receipt chain exactly as
`recCexec` does (newest move first), but carrying an authority "move" marker rather than a balance
`Turn`. The conserved measure is FIXED across an authority turn (the dual frame). -/

/-- A synthetic receipt marker for an authority turn (a self-`Turn` on the actor, amount `0`), so the
authority edit lands a row on the SAME receipt chain (`List Turn`) as balance/supply ops. It carries
no balance delta (`amt := 0`) — the chain entry records THAT an authority edit happened, while the
graph change itself is proven separately (`AuthTurn`'s `execGraph` match). -/
def authReceipt (actor : CellId) : Turn := { actor := actor, src := actor, dst := actor, amt := 0 }

  | none    => none

append an authority receipt. -/
def recCRevoke (s : RecChainedState) (holder t : CellId) : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel := recKRevokeTarget s.kernel holder t, log := authReceipt holder :: s.log }

/-- **Chained mint.** Run `recKMint`; on commit, append a supply receipt (a self-`Turn` carrying the
minted `amt` as its `balance_change` — the disclosed delta on the chain). -/

  | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := { actor := actor, src := cell, dst := cell, amt := -amt } :: s.log }
  | none    => none

/-! ## §4 — `FullAction` and `execFull`: ONE executor over the FULL op-set. -/

/-- **The FULL dregg1 op-set, as one sum.** A single `FullAction` is one of:
  * `balance a` — a catalog-typed balance/effect `Action` (dregg1's `Action`; runs via `recCexec`);
  * `delegate delegator recipient t` — a Granovetter authority grant (runs via `recKDelegate`);
  * `revoke holder t` — a target revocation (runs via `recKRevokeTarget`);
  * `mint actor cell amt` / `burn actor cell amt` — the privileged supply generators.
This widens `TurnExecutor.Action` (balance/effect only) to subsume EVERY dregg1 turn kind. -/
inductive FullAction where
  /-- A catalog-typed balance/effect action (dregg1's `Action`). -/
  | balance  (a : Action)
  /-- A Granovetter delegation: `delegator` hands `recipient` connectivity to `t`. -/
  | delegate (delegator recipient t : CellId)
  /-- A target revocation: `holder` loses every cap conferring an edge to `t`. -/
  | revoke   (holder t : CellId)
  /-- A privileged supply mint: credit `cell`'s `balance` by `amt`. -/
  | mint     (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ)
  /-- A privileged supply burn: debit `cell`'s `balance` by `amt`. -/
  | burn     (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ)

/-- **The ledger delta of a `FullAction`** — its exact effect on the conserved `recTotal`. Balance,
authority (delegate/revoke), are conservation-trivial (`0`); mint adds `amt`, burn subtracts. The

/-- **The full executor.** Dispatch each `FullAction` kind to its (reused, already-proven) chained

  | .mint actor cell amt    => recCMint s actor cell amt
  | .burn actor cell amt    => recCBurn s actor cell amt

/-- **The full turn executor.** A turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as an ALL-OR-NOTHING

/-! ## §MA — The PER-ASSET full turn executor (the `CONSERVATION_VECTOR` wired into a transaction).

§4–§10 conserve ONE scalar (`recTotal`, the `balance` field). The genuine per-asset law
(`RecordKernel.recKExecAsset_conserves_per_asset`, §MULTI-ASSET) lives over `RecordKernelState.bal`.
Here we build the full-turn executor over THAT ledger — `balanceA`/`delegate`/`revoke`/`mintA`/`burnA`
— and prove the all-or-nothing transaction moves `recTotalAsset b` by EXACTLY the net per-asset
ledger delta, for EVERY asset `b` independently. This is the executable turn whose FFI export
(`dregg_exec_full_turn`) conserves PER-ASSET (`DREGG2-GAP-MAP.md FILL 1`), not the scalar. The
`delegate`/`revoke` kinds are REUSED verbatim (`recCDelegate`/`recCRevoke`); authority is
asset-orthogonal (it edits `caps`, leaving `bal` fixed), so it contributes `0` to every asset. -/
