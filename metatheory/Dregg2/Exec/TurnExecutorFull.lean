# Dregg2.Exec.TurnExecutorFull — WIDENING the replacement executor to the FULL dregg1 op-set.

`Exec/TurnExecutor.lean`'s `execTurn` runs dregg1's call-forest of catalog-typed *balance/effect*
`Action`s as an all-or-nothing transaction, step-complete by construction (`execTurn_attests`: the
four `StepInv` conjuncts over the whole multi-`Action` turn). But dregg1's turn-executor does MORE
than balance/effect moves: it also runs **authority ops** (grant/revoke caps — the Granovetter
delegate / target-revoke) and **supply ops** (mint/burn — the only ops that legitimately move the
conserved total). For the replacement to SUBSUME every dregg1 turn kind, it must cover those too.

This module widens the executor. We introduce a single sum

  `FullAction = balance (a `TurnExecutor.Action`)
              | delegate / revoke  (an AUTHORITY turn, via `AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate` /
                                    `recKRevokeTarget`)
              | mint / burn        (a SUPPLY turn, the record-cell refinement of
                                    `Generators.execMint` / `execBurn` over the `balance` FIELD)`

and one executor `execFull : RecChainedState → FullAction → Option RecChainedState`, all over the
SAME content-addressed record world (`RecChainedState` / `recTotal` / `balOf`) that `TurnExecutor`
and `AuthTurn` already share — so the widening is genuinely ONE executor, not three. Each kind is
all-or-nothing (fail-closed gates, `Option`-monad). A whole turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as
a transaction (`execFullTurn`), exactly `execTurn`'s discipline lifted to the wider op-set.

We then PROVE that EVERY kind attests its `StepInv` obligations, packaged as `fullActionInv`:

  * **balance/effect** — Conservation (the `balance` field) ∧ Authority ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance,
    delegated VERBATIM to `recCexec_attests` (the `TurnExecutor` spine, one op);
  * **authority (delegate/revoke)** — the FRAME-FIX: `recTotal` is UNCHANGED (conservation trivially
    preserved — `recKDelegate_frame` / `recKRevokeTarget_frame`), and the cap graph is EDITED per
    `AuthTurn` (`recKDelegate_execGraph` / `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` = `Spec.addEdge`/`removeEdge`
    = `Introduce`/`Revoke` `result`); a delegation is moreover AUTHORIZED (`recKDelegate_grounds`:
    the delegator holds the source edge — "only connectivity begets connectivity");
  * **mint/burn** — the supply MOVES by exactly `±amt` (`recMint_delta` / `recBurn_delta`, the
    record-cell refinement of `Generators.mint_delta`/`burn_delta`) with the
    Generative/Annihilative DISCLOSURE obligation discharged off `CatalogEffects`
    (`g_bridgeMint`/`a_burn` color ⇒ `is_disclosed_non_conservation`), and mint/burn are AUTHORIZED
    (the privileged `mintAuthorizedB` gate — a cell cannot coin its own supply).

The headline `execFull_attests` bundles these per-kind: every committed `FullAction` attests the
relevant `StepInv` content for its kind, so the replacement executor is **step-complete across EVERY
dregg1 turn kind** — not just balance/effect. (`fullActionInv` is never weakened: each kind carries
exactly its sound obligations, with conservation tracked EXACTLY — `0` for balance/authority, `±amt`
for mint/burn — via the `ledgerDelta` book-keeping, the executable shadow of dregg1's per-domain
`excess`.)

Discipline (REORIENT §6): no `axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`. `#assert_axioms` on every
keystone. Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Reuses `TurnExecutor`/`AuthTurn`/`Generators`/
`CatalogEffects`/`RecordKernel`; edits none. Verified standalone:

/-! ## §1 — Record-cell MINT/BURN: the supply generators over the `balance` FIELD.

`Exec/Generators.lean` proves `execMint`/`execBurn` over the *scalar* `KernelState` (`bal : CellId →
ℤ`, measure `total`). The full executor lives in the *record* world (`RecordKernelState`, measure
`recTotal` over the `balance` field). So we re-found the two supply generators here over the record
cell — the EXACT analog of `Generators` but writing the named `balance` field via `setBalance` —
reusing `Generators.mintAuthorizedB` (the privileged `node`/`control` gate; bare ownership is NOT
enough to coin supply) and `Kernel.sum_indicator` (the single-point-sum technique). -/

/-- Credit cell `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` (record-cell mint write). Touches only `cell`'s
record (and only its `balance` field — every other field of the content-addressed record survives,
by `setBalance`); every other cell is untouched. -/

/-! ## §2 — The DISCLOSURE obligation for mint/burn (the Generative/Annihilative gate).

A supply move legitimately breaks `Σδ = 0`, but its delta is FORCED into the receipt — the
`is_disclosed_non_conservation` obligation `CatalogEffects` proves of the Generative
(`bridgeMint`/mint) and Annihilative (`burn`) colors. We tie each record-cell supply op to its
catalog color so the disclosure obligation is discharged for the executable op, not just abstractly.

non-conservation obligation: its supply delta must be revealed in the receipt. Discharged off

theorem burn_regime_disclosed : effectObligation burnEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl

/-! ## §3 — Authority turns lifted to `RecChainedState` (the chained delegate / revoke).

`AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate`/`recKRevokeTarget` edit `RecordKernelState.caps`. To run them inside the
unified chained executor we lift each onto `RecChainedState`, threading the receipt chain exactly as
`recCexec` does (newest move first), but carrying an authority "move" marker rather than a balance
`Turn`. The conserved measure is FIXED across an authority turn (the dual frame). -/

/-- A synthetic receipt marker for an authority turn (a self-`Turn` on the actor, amount `0`), so the
authority edit lands a row on the SAME receipt chain (`List Turn`) as balance/supply ops. It carries
no balance delta (`amt := 0`) — the chain entry records THAT an authority edit happened, while the
graph change itself is proven separately (`AuthTurn`'s `execGraph` match). -/
def authReceipt (actor : CellId) : Turn := { actor := actor, src := actor, dst := actor, amt := 0 }

append an authority receipt. -/
def recCRevoke (s : RecChainedState) (holder t : CellId) : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel := recKRevokeTarget s.kernel holder t, log := authReceipt holder :: s.log }

  | none    => none

/-! ## §4 — `FullAction` and `execFull`: ONE executor over the FULL op-set. -/

/-- **The FULL dregg1 op-set, as one sum.** A single `FullAction` is one of:
  * `balance a` — a catalog-typed balance/effect `Action` (dregg1's `Action`; runs via `recCexec`);
  * `delegate delegator recipient t` — a Granovetter authority grant (runs via `recKDelegate`);
  * `revoke holder t` — a target revocation (runs via `recKRevokeTarget`);
  * `mint actor cell amt` / `burn actor cell amt` — the privileged supply generators.
This widens `TurnExecutor.Action` (balance/effect only) to subsume EVERY dregg1 turn kind. -/
inductive FullAction where
  /-- A catalog-typed balance/effect action (dregg1's `Action`). -/
  | balance  (a : Action)
  /-- A Granovetter delegation: `delegator` hands `recipient` connectivity to `t`. -/
  | delegate (delegator recipient t : CellId)

  | revoke   (holder t : CellId)
  /-- A privileged supply mint: credit `cell`'s `balance` by `amt`. -/

/-- **The ledger delta of a `FullAction`** — its exact effect on the conserved `recTotal`. Balance,

  | .mint actor cell amt    => recCMint s actor cell amt
  | .burn actor cell amt    => recCBurn s actor cell amt

/-- **The full turn executor.** A turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as an ALL-OR-NOTHING

/-! ## §MA — The PER-ASSET full turn executor (the `CONSERVATION_VECTOR` wired into a transaction).

§4–§10 conserve ONE scalar (`recTotal`, the `balance` field). The genuine per-asset law
(`RecordKernel.recKExecAsset_conserves_per_asset`, §MULTI-ASSET) lives over `RecordKernelState.bal`.
Here we build the full-turn executor over THAT ledger — `balanceA`/`delegate`/`revoke`/`mintA`/`burnA`
— and prove the all-or-nothing transaction moves `recTotalAsset b` by EXACTLY the net per-asset
ledger delta, for EVERY asset `b` independently. This is the executable turn whose FFI export
(`dregg_exec_full_turn`) conserves PER-ASSET (`DREGG2-GAP-MAP.md FILL 1`), not the scalar. The
`delegate`/`revoke` kinds are REUSED verbatim (`recCDelegate`/`recCRevoke`); authority is
asset-orthogonal (it edits `caps`, leaving `bal` fixed), so it contributes `0` to every asset. -/

dregg1's `Effect::CreateCell` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:748`) is the PRIVILEGED creation of a FRESH
cell, born with `balance == 0` (`apply.rs:757` rejects `CreateCellNonZeroBalance`) — so on the per-asset
ledger it is conservation-NEUTRAL (`ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset). `Effect::SpawnWithDelegation`
(`apply.rs` / `EffectsSupply.spawnStep`) is `createCell` PLUS a delegated cap to the spawned child
(`Cap.node target`); the create leg is neutral and the cap grant is bal-orthogonal, so spawn is neutral
too. We reuse the `EffectsSupply` GATE shape verbatim (`mintAuthorizedB` — creation is privileged supply —
AND the freshness gate `newCell ∉ accounts`), but found the growth on `RecordKernel.createCellIntoAsset`
(grow `accounts` + RESET the fresh `bal` column to `0`), so neutrality is PROVED via

/-! ### §MA-state — the 5 PURE-STATE (field/log) effects on the per-asset dispatch.

dregg1's `turn/src/executor/apply.rs` runs FIVE effects that write the cell-RECORD (a named field)
or the LOG, and NEVER touch the per-asset `bal` ledger:

  * `SetField { cell, index, value }` (`apply_set_field` ~:497) — a state-slot write, gated by the
    `idx < STATE_SLOTS` bound + (for a cross-cell target) the `SetState` permission;
  * `EmitEvent { cell, event }` (`apply_emit_event` ~:703) — a journal append, gated ONLY by
    cell-existence (NO authority/cross-cell check — the integrity-free observation move);
  * `IncrementNonce { cell }` (`apply_increment_nonce` ~:719) — a monotone counter bump, gated by
    the `IncrementNonce` permission (cross-cell);
  * `SetPermissions { cell, new_permissions }` (`apply_set_permissions` ~:775) — the permission
    snapshot write, gated by the `SetPermissions` permission (dregg1 applies it LAST off the ORIGINAL
    permission snapshot — see the per-effect `stateAuthB` gate below);
  * `SetVerificationKey { cell, new_vk }` (`apply_set_verification_key` ~:803) — the VK-field write,
    gated by `SetVerificationKey` permission (the VK hash-integrity check is a §8 Prop-carrier
    portal, off this executable layer).

ALL FIVE carry `Effect::linearity ∈ {Neutral, Monotonic}` (`EffectsState §7`: `setField`/`emitEvent`/
`setPermissions`/`setVerificationKey` Neutral; `incrementNonce` Monotonic) — the NON-balance regime.
Their per-asset semantics are ALREADY proven in `Exec/EffectsState.lean` (`stateStep` + the
neutrality lemmas): the chained `stateStep` writes ONLY `kernel.cell` (a named field) + appends a
receipt, leaving `kernel.bal` and `kernel.accounts` literally untouched. So their `ledgerDeltaAsset`
is `0` for EVERY asset and `recTotalAsset` is UNCHANGED — balance-NEUTRALITY, proved (not assumed)
below. Here we WIRE those proven steps into the executed `execFullA` dispatch (we do NOT re-prove the
per-effect semantics). -/

/-- **Balance-NEUTRALITY of a field write over the per-asset ledger — PROVED (the load-bearing
keystone for the 5 pure-state effects).** `EffectsState.writeField` updates ONLY the record map
`cell` of the kernel; it touches NEITHER `bal` NOR `accounts`. So `recTotalAsset` (= `∑ c ∈
accounts, bal c b`) is LITERALLY UNCHANGED for EVERY asset `b`. THIS is what makes the 5 pure-state
effects per-asset conservation-trivial: a `nonce`/`status`/`permissions`/`vk` write cannot move ANY
asset's supply. (Contrast `recBalCredit_recTotalAsset`, which DOES move `bal` — these effects never
write `bal`.) -/
theorem writeField_recTotalAsset (k : RecordKernelState) (f : FieldName) (target : CellId)
    (v : Value) (b : AssetId) : recTotalAsset (writeField k f target v) b = recTotalAsset k b := by
  -- `writeField k f target v = { k with cell := … }`; `bal` and `accounts` are the SAME projections.
  rfl

/-- **Balance-NEUTRALITY of a committed `stateStep` over the per-asset ledger — PROVED.** A committed
`EffectsState.stateStep` (the chained field-write the 5 pure-state effects run) leaves `recTotalAsset
b` UNCHANGED for EVERY asset `b`: it writes a named record field, never the `bal` ledger. The
per-asset analog of `EffectsState.state_conserves` (which preserved the scalar `recTotal`); here it
holds for the asset VECTOR with NO side-condition on the field name (a write to ANY field, even
`balance`, leaves the `bal` ledger fixed — the `bal` ledger is independent of the `cell` record). -/
theorem stateStep_recTotalAsset {s s' : RecChainedState} {f : FieldName} {actor target : CellId}

  exact writeField_recTotalAsset s.kernel f target v b

/-- **The `EmitEvent` chained step — log-only, authority-FREE (dregg1 `apply_emit_event` ~:703).**
Unlike the field-writing effects, `EmitEvent` runs NO authority/cross-cell check (in dregg1 the only
gate is cell-existence) and writes NO state — it appends an event receipt to the chain and nothing
else. We model the observation faithfully: a self-`Turn` receipt (amount `0`) carrying the event,
with the kernel UNCHANGED (so `bal`/`cell`/`caps`/`accounts` are all fixed). The `topic`/`data`
ride the receipt's `src`/`dst` as the event payload markers. ALWAYS commits (no gate). -/
def emitStep (s : RecChainedState) (actor cell : CellId) (topic data : Int) : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel := s.kernel,
    log    := { actor := actor, src := cell, dst := cell, amt := 0 } :: s.log }

/-- **`emitStep` is balance-NEUTRAL — PROVED.** `EmitEvent` leaves the kernel (hence `recTotalAsset
b` for EVERY asset `b`) UNCHANGED — it only appends a receipt. -/

/-! ### §MA-auth — the 6 DISTINCT AUTHORITY effects on the per-asset dispatch.

dregg1's `turn/src/executor/apply.rs` runs a cluster of capability-graph effects BEYOND the bare
`delegate`/`revoke` already wired above. Each EDITS (or merely CHECKS) the `caps` cap-graph and
NEVER the `bal` ledger — so `ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset and `recTotalAsset` is UNCHANGED
(balance-NEUTRAL). The HEADLINE obligation for this cluster is NON-AMPLIFICATION — the genuine
`capAuthConferred ⊆` over the REAL `List Auth` lattice (`attenuate_subset`), not a `()≤()` collapse.

  * `Introduce { introducer, recipient, target, permissions }` (`apply.rs:2791`, `:2835`
    "amplification denied") — the 3-party Granovetter introduce. Reuses the proven `recCDelegate`
    connectivity spine; the rights it confers are an ATTENUATION of a held cap (`attenuate_subset`).
  * `AttenuateCapability { cell, slot, narrower_permissions }` (`apply.rs:4377`) — monotonically
    NARROW a held cap in the actor's c-list (widening rejected). The purest non-amplification.
  * `DropRef { ref_id }` (`apply.rs:4034`) — a CapTP GC decrement: the holder drops its edge to the
    target. Reuses `recKRevokeTarget` (`removeEdge`); authority strictly shrinks.
  * `RevokeDelegation { child }` (`apply.rs:3044`) — a parent revokes a child's delegation. Reuses
    `recKRevokeTarget` (`removeEdge`). (Distinct dregg1 op from `DropRef`; same graph move.)
  * `ValidateHandoff { … }` (`apply.rs:4069`) — accept a two-signature CapTP handoff certificate.
    The handoff IS a Granovetter introduce, so the conferred (attenuated) cap is non-amplifying
    (`granted ⊆ held`, `attenuate_subset`). The two-signature crypto is a §8 Prop-carrier portal.
  * `ExerciseViaCapability { cap_slot, inner_effects }` (`apply.rs:2441`) — exercise a HELD cap. The
    cap graph is UNCHANGED (only connectivity begets connectivity); gated on holding the edge.

These REUSE the proofs of `Exec.EffectsAuthority` (which we cannot import — it sits DOWNSTREAM of
this module — so we re-found the two missing chained wrappers `attenuateStepA`/`exerciseStepA` here,
mirroring `recCDelegate`, and discharge the non-amplification directly from `Caps.attenuate_subset`,
the SAME proof `EffectsAuthority.attenuate_non_amplifying`/`introduce_non_amplifying` reuse). -/

/-- **`IsNonAmplifyingF held granted`** — the genuine non-amplification predicate over the REAL
rights lattice: the granted cap confers a `List Auth` SUBSET of the held cap's authority
(`is_attenuation(held, granted)`, `apply.rs:2835`). NOT a `()≤()` skeleton; an amplifying grant
(`granted ⊄ held`) makes it FALSE — the predicate has teeth (`amplifyingF_rejected`). The local twin
of `EffectsAuthority.IsNonAmplifying`. -/
def IsNonAmplifyingF (held granted : Cap) : Prop :=
  capAuthConferred granted ⊆ capAuthConferred held

/-- **`amplifyingF_rejected` — THE TEETH (PROVED).** A `granted` cap conferring an authority `a` the
`held` cap does NOT confer is REJECTED (`¬ IsNonAmplifyingF held granted`). So the non-amplification
gate genuinely discriminates — it is not vacuously true. -/

    (hgranted : a ∈ capAuthConferred granted) (hheld : a ∉ capAuthConferred held) :

/-- **`attenuateF_non_amplifying` — THE HEADLINE (PROVED, GENUINE).** The narrowed cap confers a
genuine `List Auth` SUBSET of the original: `capAuthConferred (attenuate keep c) ⊆ capAuthConferred
c`, via `Caps.attenuate_subset`. This is the executable `is_narrower_or_equal` (widening denied) —
the SAME proof `EffectsAuthority.attenuate_non_amplifying`/`introduce_non_amplifying` carry. -/

/-! ### §MA-escrow — the COMBINED PER-ASSET holding-store on the executed dispatch (`META-FILL C`).

dregg1's escrow/obligation/committed-escrow are NOT balance-conserving two-cell transfers: they DEBIT
ONE cell and park the value in an off-ledger side-table, conserving only the COMBINED total across the
create+settle PAIR (`RecordKernel §ESCROW`). On the per-asset `bal` ledger this is
`RecordKernel.createEscrowKAsset`/`releaseEscrowKAsset`/`refundEscrowKAsset`, which conserve the
COMBINED per-asset measure `recTotalAssetWithEscrow`. We re-found their CHAINED wrappers HERE (mirroring
`attenuateStepA`/`exerciseStepA`, since `EffectsPaired` sits parallel and is not imported), and wire
them into the executed `execFullA` dispatch. The escrow legs move the BARE `recTotalAsset` by ∓amount at
the locked asset (`ledgerDeltaAsset`), but conserve the COMBINED measure (`combinedDeltaAsset = 0`).
Note effects move SETS (nullifier/commitment), not `bal`, so both deltas are `0`. -/

/-! ## §MB — `execFullTurnA_append` + the per-asset PER-NODE attestation carrier.

The forest lift in `Exec/FullForest.lean` rests on the same `execTurn_append` shape `TurnForest.lean`
uses for the narrow executor — here re-founded for the per-asset `execFullTurnA`. We then build the
per-asset analog of `fullActionInv` (`fullActionInvA`) whose **Ledger** conjunct is the full per-asset
VECTOR (`∀ b, recTotalAsset … = … + ledgerDeltaAsset fa b`, never one aggregate scalar — the FILL-1
no-laundering carrier), with ChainLink/ObsAdvance/KindObligation reused per-kind (these are
asset-orthogonal: they edit the log / `caps`, not the `bal` ledger). `execFullTurnA_each_attests`
then threads the per-node witness along the all-or-nothing fold, so the forest's per-node
attestation (`FullForest.execFullForestA_each_attests`) lifts straight off the bridge. -/

/-- **`execFullTurnA_append` — PROVED.** Running a concatenated per-asset turn equals running the
prefix and, on success, the suffix (the `execTurn_append` shape for `execFullTurnA`). The
associativity the forest pre-order flattening rests on. Mirrors `TurnForest.execTurn_append` verbatim
with `recCexec`→`execFullA`, induction on `xs`. -/
