# Dregg2.Exec.RecordKernel — the kernel laws over a CONTENT-ADDRESSED record cell-state.

`Exec/Kernel.lean` is the verified *micro-core*: its `KernelState.bal : CellId → ℤ` is a single
scalar ledger, and `exec_conserves`/`exec_authorized`/`exec_unauthorized_fails` are PROVED over
that whole-state ℤ. But the concrete dregg2 cell is NOT a scalar — it is `Exec/Value.lean`'s
schema-keyed record `Value` (named fields, `flatten`/`width`/`conforms`, `flatten_width` PROVED).
The construction study's single-highest-leverage move (`docs/rebuild/PHASE-CONSTRUCTION.md §1`,
"The single highest-leverage next move") is to replace the toy scalar ledger with that
content-addressed record cell and re-prove the kernel laws over a NAMED FIELD (`balance`) rather
than the whole-state ℤ — aligning the conserved quantity with `Spec/Conservation`'s domain-typed
conservation (`conservedInDomain Domain.balance`).

This module does exactly that, as a SECOND, parallel kernel ALONGSIDE the scalar one (the
sanctioned fallback when a full in-place lift of `KernelState` ripples too far — here it ripples
across ~8 `Finset.sum`-heavy `Exec/*` files). The toy scalar kernel stays UNTOUCHED and green; we
add `RecordKernelState` + `recKExec` whose cell-state is a `Value` record, conserve the **`balance`
field**, and re-prove ALL THREE kernel laws + the four-conjunct `StepInv` over it. The conserved
quantity becomes a domain measure over a named field — the `Spec.conservedInDomain Domain.balance`
shape — so this is the concrete-instance seam between "verified micro-core" and "verified dregg".

`flatten_width` (from `Value.lean`) is the foundation lemma the *circuit* side rests on; the
*semantic* re-proof here rests on `Value.scalar "balance"` (the named-field read), reusing
`Exec/Kernel.lean`'s already-proved `sum_indicator` over the `balance`-field measure.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Imports `Exec.Program` (for `Value.scalar`/`Value.field`) and
`Exec.Kernel` (for `CellId`/`Turn`/`authorizedB`/`Caps` + the reused `sum_indicator`).

/-! ## The record cell-state and its `balance`-field measure. -/

/-- The canonical name of a cell's fungible balance field. The conserved quantity lives HERE —
not in the whole-state ℤ, but in this NAMED field of the content-addressed record. -/
def balanceField : FieldName := "balance"

/-- **An asset identity.** A dregg cell holds MANY assets, and conservation must be **per-asset**,
never one aggregate scalar (`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`; `dregg2 §2.1`). A turn that moves
5 of asset 0 must leave the supply of asset 1 *literally untouched* — folding all assets into one
sum would let a cell silently swap one asset for another while the aggregate stays put. The
conserved quantity is therefore a *family* indexed by `AssetId` (see `§MULTI-ASSET` below). -/
abbrev AssetId : Type := Nat

/-- **`balOf v`** — read a cell record's `balance` field as an `Int`, defaulting an
absent/ill-typed field to `0` (fail-soft on the *measure*: a malformed record contributes `0` to
the total, never crashes the sum — the data-tier shadow of `Value.flatten`'s zero-default). This
is the named-field measure that replaces `KernelState.bal`'s whole-state scalar. -/

/-! ### The OFF-LEDGER holding-store: the escrow side-table (dregg1's `self.escrows`).

dregg1's `apply_create_escrow` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:1674`) does NOT do a balance-conserving
two-cell transfer. It does a SINGLE-cell debit (`set_balance(creator − amount)`, :1766) and inserts
an `EscrowRecord` into an **off-ledger side-table** `self.escrows` (:1770), keyed by `escrow_id`,
carrying `{creator, recipient, amount, resolved}`. `apply_release_escrow` (:1959) credits the
recipient single-handedly and marks the record `resolved`; `apply_refund_escrow` (:2030) credits the
creator single-handedly and marks resolved. So per-effect Σδ ≠ 0 on the cell ledger — conservation
holds only ACROSS the create+release/refund PAIR, with the side-table accounting for the in-flight
amount. We model that side-table faithfully here. -/

/-- **`EscrowRecord`** — one entry of dregg1's off-ledger `escrows` side-table (`apply.rs:1773`),
keyed by `id`, carrying the locked `amount`, the `creator` (refund target) and `recipient` (release
target), and the `resolved` flag (set true once released/refunded). An UNRESOLVED record holds
`amount` of value OUT of the cell ledger — that is the holding-store value the pair conserves. -/

/-- **Record kernel state:** the finite set of live `accounts`, a per-cell **content-addressed
record** state (`cell : CellId → Value`, each a `Value.record` carrying at least a `balance`
field), and the capability table — PLUS dregg1's two off-ledger side-tables, both DEFAULTING EMPTY
so every existing construction/proof that ignores them is unaffected (the additive extension):

  * `escrows` — the off-ledger escrow holding-store (`self.escrows`); unresolved records hold value
    out of the cell ledger (`apply.rs:1770`);
  * `nullifiers` — the spent-note nullifier SET (`self.note_nullifiers`, `apply.rs:941`); a
    `NoteSpend` inserts its nullifier and is rejected fail-closed if already present (double-spend).

This is `KernelState` with `bal : CellId → ℤ` lifted to `cell : CellId → Value`, additively extended
with the two holding stores — the concrete dregg2 cell + dregg1's real side-table accounting. -/

  every existing construction/proof that ignores it is unaffected (the additive extension, exactly
  as `escrows`/`nullifiers` were added). This is the destination conserved measure the per-asset
  transition (`§MULTI-ASSET`) preserves; the scalar `balance` field is its legacy asset-view, and

/-! ## §MULTI-ASSET — the per-asset `CONSERVATION_VECTOR` over the REAL executable state + gate.

`recKExec`/`recTotal` above conserve ONE scalar (the `balance` field). A dregg cell holds MANY
assets, and conservation must be PER-ASSET — a committed turn moving asset `a` must leave EVERY
other asset's supply *literally untouched*; folding all assets into one aggregate would let a cell
silently swap asset A for asset B while the scalar stays put (`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`;
`DREGG2-GAP-MAP.md FILL 1`, "the #1 soundness gap"). `Exec.MultiAsset` proved exactly this — but
over a deliberately PARALLEL `MACellId`/`maAuthorizedB` toy that "cannot clash with `Kernel.CellId`"
and is imported by nothing executable (a sibling law). Here we re-prove it over the REAL
`RecordKernelState.bal` ledger and the REAL `authorizedB k.caps` gate — the SAME state type and
authority the FFI's `execFullTurn` runs — so the per-asset law is no longer a sibling. (Migrating
the executable `FullAction` dispatch onto `bal` + the negative differential is the next phase.) -/

/-! ## Per-asset ACCOUNT-GROWTH: a fresh cell, born EMPTY in every asset (`META-FILL C`).

dregg1's `Effect::CreateCell` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:748`) is a PRIVILEGED creation of a FRESH
cell that — per `apply_create_cell`'s `CreateCellNonZeroBalance` rejection (`apply.rs:757`) — is born
with `balance == 0` (`Cell::with_balance(.,.,0)`): conservation-NEUTRAL. We grow the per-asset ledger's
index set (`accounts`) while keeping the conserved measure `recTotalAsset` UNCHANGED, by INSERTING the
fresh cell AND resetting its `bal` column to `0` for every asset — so the new term in the sum is exactly
`0`. The `bal`-reset is LOAD-BEARING: a freshly-inserted id that had EVER been credited (a re-inserted
previously-credited id) would silently re-introduce supply on insert. Resetting unconditionally defends

The `recKExec` transfer above is balance-CONSERVING (the `transfer` effect, Σδ = 0). But dregg1's
escrow is NOT a transfer: `apply_create_escrow` debits ONE cell and parks the value in the off-ledger
`escrows` side-table; `apply_release_escrow`/`apply_refund_escrow` credit ONE cell and mark the
record resolved. So per-effect Σδ ≠ 0 on the cell ledger; the conserved quantity is the COMBINED
total (cell-ledger + the value held by unresolved escrows). This section models that faithfully and
proves the REAL invariant: value is conserved ACROSS the create+release/refund pair, with the
side-table accounting for the in-flight amount. -/

/-! ### §NULLIFIER — the spent-note SET (faithful to dregg1's `note_nullifiers`, `apply.rs:941`).

dregg1's `apply_note_spend` does NOT set a `"nullifier_spent"=1` scalar field. It inserts the
nullifier into an off-ledger SET `self.note_nullifiers` with DOUBLE-SPEND REJECTION: if the nullifier
is already present, the turn fails-closed ("double-spend: nullifier already in note_nullifiers set",
`apply.rs:945`). We model that set faithfully and prove no nullifier can be spent twice. -/

/-- **`noteSpendNullifier` (executable, fail-closed).** Insert `nf` into the nullifier set IF it is
NOT already present; reject (fail-closed `none`) on a double-spend (`apply.rs:942`). The crypto
(STARK spending proof + nullifier derivation) is the §8 portal carried at the effect layer; here we
model the ledger-side double-spend gate, which is what prevents replay. -/

`noteSpendNullifier` fails-closed. This is the real anti-replay invariant (the SET prevents it), NOT
a scalar flag. -/

/-- **`note_spend_inserts` — PROVED.** A committed `noteSpendNullifier` actually inserts `nf` into the
set (so a SUBSEQUENT spend of the same `nf` is rejected by `note_no_double_spend`). -/

a second spend of the SAME `nf` on the resulting state fails-closed. Double-spend is impossible. -/
