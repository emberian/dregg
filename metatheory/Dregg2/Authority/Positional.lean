# Dregg2.Authority.Positional — the l4v integrity lift = the vat-boundary law.

This module is the **literal Lean transcription of the seL4/l4v object-integrity
theorem** (`integrity_obj_atomic`, `proof/access-control/Access.thy`), specialized to
the dregg2 vat model. The l4v case-split IS the vat-boundary law:

  * l4v `troa_lrefl`  : `l ∈ subjects ⟹ integrity_obj_atomic … ko ko'`
      "a subject can make ANY change to an object it owns — no policy edge required."
    ↦ **intra-vat**: own-it ⟹ arbitrary change, admitted by the *trivial* witness.

  * l4v `troa_ntfn`/`troa_ep`/… : a non-owner may change `ko` ONLY along an
      *authorized policy edge* `(s, auth, l) ∈ pasPolicy aag` for the specific
      `auth` that the object kind permits.
    ↦ **cross-vat**: change admitted ⟺ `Discharged P w` (a verified witness for
      an edge the policy authorizes) — the crypto substitution replaces l4v's
      positional `∃ (s,auth,l) ∈ pasPolicy` with the decidable `Verify P w = true`.

Authority confinement (`pas_refined`'s `state_objs_in_policy`) lifts to: the policy
is an *upper bound* on conferred authority — `authority ⊆ caps`, an invariant, never
growth. The `LossyMorphism` (`ρ_in`/`ρ_out`, attenuation-only) lifts structural
unforgeability to cryptographic unforgeability with loss = revocation-by-construction.

/-! ## The capability model (lift of l4v `cap` + `cap_auth_conferred`) -/

`Receive, SyncSend, Notify, Reset, Grant, Call, Reply, Control`). -/

/-- Trust roots / labels. Lift of l4v `'a` (the agent-label type, ranged over by
`pasObjectAbs aag x`, `pasSubject aag`). In dregg2 these are vats. -/
abbrev Label := Nat

/-- A capability. Lift of l4v `cap`. A cap names a target object and carries rights.
The full l4v `cap` datatype is large (`NullCap`, `EndpointCap oref badge r`,
`ReplyCap`, `CNodeCap`, `ThreadCap`, `ArchObjectCap …`); we keep the rights-bearing
core that determines `cap_auth_conferred`. -/
inductive Cap where

  /-- `endpoint target rights` ~ l4v `EndpointCap oref badge r`. -/
  | endpoint (target : Label) (rights : List Auth)
  /-- `node target` ~ l4v `CNodeCap`/`ThreadCap`/`Control`-conferring caps. -/
  | node (target : Label)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **`cap_auth_conferred`** — the authority a cap confers. Verbatim l4v
(`Access.thy:118`):
```
cap_auth_conferred cap ≡ case cap of
    NullCap ⇒ {}
  | UntypedCap … ⇒ {Control}
  | EndpointCap oref badge r ⇒ cap_rights_to_auth r True
  | CNodeCap … | ThreadCap … | … ⇒ {Control}

/-- The set of caps held at (the slots of) a label — the cell's slot-table. -/
abbrev Caps := Label → List Cap

/-- A policy edge `(s, auth, l)`: subject `s` may exert `auth` on label `l`.
Lift of a single element of l4v `pasPolicy aag : ('a × auth × 'a) set`. -/

/-! ## `pas_refined` invariant: authority ⊆ caps (no growth) -/

/-- **`pas_refined` (the `state_objs_in_policy` clause), lifted.** Verbatim l4v
(`Access.thy:312`) requires, among wellformedness clauses,
`auth_graph_map (pasObjectAbs aag) (state_objs_to_policy s) ⊆ pasPolicy aag`.

Here: every authority actually conferred by a held cap is *bounded above* by a
policy edge. The policy is an upper bound; runtime authority never exceeds it. -/

/- A cell-object state (lift of l4v `kernel_object option`, the `ko`/`ko'`).
Kept fully abstract here; instantiated per candidate in the soundness module.
`W` is an *explicit* parameter of `Integrity` below: it appears only inside the
`cross` constructor's existential and in the `Verifiable P W` instance, never in
an index, so it cannot be inferred at use sites and must be supplied positionally. -/

`Integrity owner subjects ko ko'` holds iff the change `ko ⟶ ko'` is admissible.
Two constructors mirror the l4v case-split exactly:

* `intra` ↦ l4v `troa_lrefl` (`l ∈ subjects`): the owning vat may make an
  ARBITRARY change to its own object — admitted by the **trivial witness**, NO
  policy edge consulted.
* `cross` ↦ l4v `troa_ntfn`/`troa_ep`/… : a non-owner change is admitted ONLY when
  a witness *discharges* the admissibility predicate `p` for the change, i.e.
  `Discharged p w` — the decidable replacement for l4v's positional
  `∃ (s,auth,l) ∈ pasPolicy aag`. -/

/-- A boundary morphism with an *inbound* restriction `ρ_in` and an *outbound*
restriction `ρ_out`. Crossing a vat boundary may only ATTENUATE authority (remove
rights / narrow predicates); it can never amplify. **Attenuation is part of the
definition** — the structure carries the proofs `in_le`/`out_le` as fields (a
non-attenuating endomap is simply not a `LossyMorphism`); this is *loss =
revocation-by-construction*. (Statement-repair: the earlier version omitted these
fields, making the attenuation theorem unprovable for an arbitrary morphism.) -/

  /-- The outbound restriction never amplifies. -/
  out_le : ∀ a, ρ_out a ≤ a

/-- **LossyMorphism attenuation — PROVED** (now that attenuation is a structure field):
`ρ_in`/`ρ_out` are attenuation-only, so structural unforgeability lifts to cryptographic
unforgeability and *loss is revocation-by-construction* — a right not carried across the
boundary is, by construction, unexercisable on the far side. -/
