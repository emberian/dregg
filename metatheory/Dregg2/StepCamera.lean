# Dregg2.StepCamera — the step-indexed Iris camera: promoting the discrete RA.

`Resource.lean` builds the **discrete** resource-algebra tier: a partial commutative
monoid `(op, valid, core)` carving out NFTs, fractional permissions, the
authoritative↔fragment split. A discrete RA suffices as long as a resource's validity
talks only about *itself* (a field sum, a `≤ 1` share, a `f ≼ a` fit). It does NOT
suffice the moment a resource makes a statement about *another cell's* state.

## Why dregg2 needs step-indexing (the motivation)
A dregg2 cell can hold a capability whose validity quantifies over a **different cell's
invariant** — "this cap is valid only while cell `Y` maintains property `Q`", where `Q`
itself ranges over resources (including, transitively, caps back into this cell). That is
**higher-order / recursive ghost state**: the domain of resources `R` would have to
contain predicates over `R`, a negative self-reference (`R ≅ … → Prop R …`) with no
solution in plain `Set`/`Type` (cardinality / Reynolds). A *discrete* RA cannot host it.

Iris's resolution (Jung et al., *Iris from the Ground Up*, JFP 2018, §3–4) is to give the
resource carrier the structure of an **OFE** — an ordered family of equivalences,
`x ≡{n}≡ y` ("equal for `n` steps of observation") — and to make `op`/`core` and validity
**step-indexed and non-expansive**. The recursive domain equation is then solved as a
**guarded fixpoint** (`iProp ≅ ▶ (… → iProp …)`), where every recursive occurrence sits
under a *later* `▶`. The step-index decrement at `▶` is what makes the otherwise-circular
definition well-founded: at index `n` a resource only ever inspects its recursive parts at
index `< n` (Birkedal et al., *guarded dependent type theory* / the `▷` modality;
América–Rutten metric-space fixpoints).

**This `▶` is the SAME "later" as `Boundary.lean`'s guard.** `Boundary.Later` guards the
tail of a cell's coinductive unfold (productivity over unbounded time, typed off
`previous_receipt_hash`); the camera's `▶` guards the recursive occurrence of resources
inside that unfold (well-definedness of higher-order ghost state). They are one modality —
which is exactly how Iris builds `iProp` as a guarded fixpoint *over the camera of
resources*: the coinductive cell (`νF`) and the recursive resource live under the same
`▷`. A `dregg2` cell that reasons about another cell's future is reasoning one `▶`-step
out, and the resource it holds about that future is one `▶`-step "smaller" — the two
decrements are the same decrement.

## What is here
* `OFE` — the step-indexed equivalence structure (the metric/ultrametric on resources).
* `Later` — `x ≡{n}≡ y` "one step later" (`▷`), tied to `Boundary.Later`.
* `NonExpansive` — maps that preserve `≡{n}≡` (the morphisms of OFEs).
* `Camera` — `ResourceAlgebra` + `OFE` + step-indexed `validN` + non-expansive
  `op`/`core` + the **extension axiom** (the laws beyond the discrete RA).
* `discrete_camera_of_RA` — every discrete RA is a camera under the trivial OFE
  (`≡{n}≡` = `=`); the discrete tier of `Resource.lean` is the `n`-collapsed special case.
* a design note pinning the higher-order obligation that forces all of the above.

Style: spec-first, grind up — faithful Props, `sorry` bodies; data defined where cheap.

/-! ## `OFE` — ordered family of equivalences (the step-indexing) -/

/-- **An ordered family of equivalences (OFE)** on `α`: a family of equivalence relations
`Eqv n : α → α → Prop` indexed by an observation depth `n : Nat`, the discrete analogue of
an (ultra)metric. `x ≡{n}≡ y` reads "`x` and `y` are indistinguishable by any observer that
runs for `n` steps". The four laws make this an OFE in the sense of Jung et al. (JFP 2018,
§3.1):

* each `Eqv n` is an **equivalence relation** (refl/symm/trans) — at every depth,
  indistinguishability is a genuine equivalence;
* **downward closure** (`Eqv (n+1) x y → Eqv n x y`) — more observation steps is a finer
  relation; coarser at shallower depth;
* the **limit property** (`(∀ n, Eqv n x y) → x = y`) — indistinguishable at *every* depth
  ⇒ equal (the OFE is *separated*; the only "ideal points" are real points).

Note: there is deliberately **no `Eqv 0`-totality axiom**. Iris's `dist 0` is total only in
the *step-indexed* OFE construction (where `dist n` is built by a decreasing approximation),
not as a law of the OFE structure itself: an OFE requires only that each `dist n` be an
equivalence, downward closure, and the limit (Jung et al. JFP 2018, §3.1, Def. 3.1 — the
`dist`-laws are reflexivity-as-equivalence + mono + limit). Demanding `Eqv 0 x y` for *all*
`x y` would exclude the **discrete OFE** (`Eqv n := Eq` at every depth), which is the very
embedding `discrete_camera_of_RA` builds — and would force the camera's raw-`Eq`
conclusions (`core_nonExpansive`, `extend`) to fail at `n = 0`. So the totality is dropped
as the non-axiom it is; `Later 0 := True` (below) still gives the contractive base case.

This step-indexing is precisely what makes recursive / higher-order resources
well-defined: a resource at depth `n` may inspect its recursive sub-resources only at
depth `< n`, so the would-be-circular domain equation is solved as a guarded fixpoint. -/

open OFE

/-- `Later n x y` — `x ≡{n}≡ y` **"one step later"** (`▷`): equality "now" at depth `n`
demands agreement at depth `n - 1`. At `n = 0` it is trivially true (the future beyond a
zero-step observer is unconstrained — the contractive base case); at `n + 1` it is `Eqv n`.
Decrementing the index is what gives a *contractive* (well-founded) recursive occurrence.

This is the camera-tier reflection of `Boundary.Later`: that `▶` guards the tail of a
cell's coinductive unfold; this `▶` guards the recursive occurrence of resources inside
that unfold. The decrement here (`n + 1 ↦ n`) is the SAME `▶`-step as the guard that makes
`Boundary`'s `IsBisim`/`BoundaryRespecting` productive — Iris's one `▷`, shared by the
coinductive cell `νF` and the recursive resource living in it. -/

/-! ## `NonExpansive` — the morphisms of OFEs -/

/-- **`f` is non-expansive**: it preserves `n`-step indistinguishability for every `n`
(`x ≡{n}≡ y → f x ≡{n}≡ f y`). Non-expansive maps are the morphisms of the category of
OFEs; in a camera, `op` (in each argument) and `core` must be non-expansive so that the
guarded fixpoint that builds `iProp` lands in OFEs at every stage (Jung et al. §3.1,
§4.2). Intuitively: an operation cannot let an observer *gain* distinguishing power it did
not already have on the inputs. -/

  ∀ n x y, Eqv n x y → Eqv n (f x) (f y)

/-- A non-expansive map respects the `▷` modality too: `Later`-agreement of inputs gives
`Later`-agreement of outputs (`f` commutes with `▶`). Used when threading non-expansive
operations through guarded recursive definitions. -/

/-! ## `Camera` — the FULL Iris camera (discrete RA + OFE + step-indexed validity) -/

/-- **A camera (Iris `cmra`)** — the FULL resource structure: a discrete
`ResourceAlgebra` *and* an `OFE`, glued by a **step-indexed validity** `validN n a`
(`✓{n} a`, "`a` is valid for `n` observation steps") plus the non-expansiveness and
extension laws that the discrete RA lacks. This is the tier dregg2 needs for higher-order /
recursive ghost state (caps that quantify over another cell's invariant); the discrete RA
of `Resource.lean` is the `n`-collapsed special case (`discrete_camera_of_RA`).

The fields beyond the discrete RA (Jung et al. JFP 2018, §4.1, Def. of `CMRA`):

* `validN_mono` — `✓{n}` is **downward-closed in `n`**: validity for more steps implies
  validity for fewer (a resource cannot become valid by observing it *longer*);
* `valid_iff_validN` — the discrete `valid` is the **limit** of `validN`: `✓ a ↔ ∀ n, ✓{n} a`
  (a resource is "really" valid iff it is valid at every finite depth);
* `validN_eqv` — `✓{n}` respects `≡{n}≡` (validity is itself non-expansive: `n`-equal
  resources are `n`-equally valid);
* `op_nonExpansive_r` / `core_nonExpansive` — `op` (in its right argument; left follows by
  commutativity of the underlying RA) and `core` are **non-expansive**;
* `extend` — the **EXTENSION axiom**, the camera's keystone and the one law with no
  discrete analogue: if `a` is `n`-valid and looks (at depth `n`) like a composite
  `op b1 b2`, then `a` *actually decomposes* as `op c1 c2` with `c1 ≡{n}≡ b1`,
  `c2 ≡{n}≡ b2`. It lets you split a resource along an approximate (step-`n`) decomposition
  into a *real* one — the property that makes the later-eliminated `iProp` separation
  conjunction commute with the step-index, and without which the guarded fixpoint would
  not respect `op`. -/

/-! ## The discrete embedding: a discrete RA is the `n`-collapsed camera -/

/-- **The trivial (discrete) OFE on any type**: `x ≡{n}≡ y ≜ x = y` at **every** depth,
including `n = 0`. Every OFE law holds: each `Eqv n` is `Eq` (an equivalence); downward
closure is immediate (`Eq → Eq`); and the limit is trivial (any single `Eqv n` already
gives `x = y`). This is the faithful discrete OFE (Jung et al. JFP 2018, §4.1 "discrete
cmra"): with no `Eqv 0`-totality axiom (see `OFE`), `Eqv := Eq` is admissible at all
depths, which is exactly what makes the camera's raw-`Eq` conclusions (`core_nonExpansive`,
`extend`) discharge at `n = 0`. Used to embed `Resource.lean`'s discrete RAs as cameras. -/
def discreteEqv {α : Type u} : Nat → α → α → Prop
  | _, x, y => x = y

/-- **Every discrete resource algebra is a camera** under the discrete OFE
(`x ≡{n}≡ y` ≜ `discreteEqv n x y`) with `validN n a ≜ valid a` for `n ≥ 1`. This is the
*discrete embedding* (Jung et al. §4.1: every "discrete cmra"/RA is a cmra): the
step-index does nothing, `validN` collapses to `valid`, non-expansiveness is by
substitution, and the extension axiom is just associativity/decomposition with the
`≡{n}≡` read as `=`. It exhibits `Resource.lean`'s discrete tier as the `n`-collapsed
special case of the full camera — the bottom rung of the same ladder.

**PROVED (no `sorry`):** the full `Camera R` instance is constructed below. With the
`Eqv 0`-totality non-axiom dropped from `OFE`, the faithful discrete OFE `Eqv n := Eq`
(`discreteEqv`) is admissible at every depth (including `n = 0`); then every camera field
reads through `=` (the OFE laws are `Eq` refl/symm/trans/mono/limit, `validN` collapses to
`valid`, non-expansiveness is `Eq`-congruence, and `extend` is exact). -/

/-- **`Later n` agreement is congruent under `Eqv n` (the guard lemma) — PROVED.** If
`x ≡{n}≡ y`, then `x` and `y` are `▶`-related to the *same* points: `Later n x z ↔ Later n y z`.
At `n + 1` this is `Eqv n x z ↔ Eqv n y z`, which follows from `Eqv (n+1) x y` by
`eqv_mono` (down to depth `n`) + symmetry/transitivity. This is the engine that makes a
`▶`-guarded validity predicate non-expansive: an `n`-step observer cannot tell `x` from `y`
apart in *which futures they guard*. -/

/-- **`recursive_resource_needs_step_index` — the design law, PROVED at every depth.** A
dregg2 resource is *higher-order* when its validity quantifies over a predicate on resources
of the *same* algebra (a cap whose validity asserts another cell maintains an invariant `Q`,
`Q : R → Prop`). The law: for such a validity `v` to be **non-expansive** (hence to live in a
camera and admit a guarded fixpoint), it suffices that the inner quantification be `▶`-GUARDED
— `v x ↔ ∀ y, Later n x y → Q y`. Under that guard, `v` is non-expansive at *every* depth `n`,
INCLUDING the contractive successor depths `n + 1` where the guard genuinely decrements
(`Later (n+1) = Eqv n`) and the observer compares futures at depth `n`, not the degenerate
`Later 0 = True`.

This is the precise statement of "the guard makes recursive ghost state well-defined": the
proof at `n + 1` runs entirely through `later_congr_left`, i.e. it *uses* the `▶`-decrement
(`eqv_mono : Eqv (n+1) → Eqv n`). An *unguarded* `v` (one that fed `Eqv n x y` to `Q`
directly, with no `Later`) would NOT be non-expansive — the guard is load-bearing, which is
exactly why "a cell making statements about another cell's state needs step-indexing." The
earlier version pinned the guard at the degenerate `Later 0` (≡ `True`), making `v`
x-independent and the conclusion vacuous; this states and proves the real guarded law for
arbitrary `n`. -/
