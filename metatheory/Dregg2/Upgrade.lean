# Dregg2.Upgrade — the anti-brick `set_program` upgrade law.

This module encodes dregg2's **anti-brick upgrade clause** (`dregg2-multicell-privacy.md §3`):
the #1 thing the design was missing, ADOPTED from Mina's `permissions.ml`.

**The hazard.** dregg2 *will* swap its recursion backend / AIR encoding (the deferred
`RecursionBackend` / `FriRecursionBackend` trait swap; `circuit/src/plonky3_recursion_impl.rs`,
design §7: depth-as-security-parameter, recursion deferrable). The instant that happens, every
live `Circuit{circuit_hash}` cell pinned to the *old* proof system becomes unverifiable —
**bricked**: it can no longer produce a proof its own verifier will accept, so it can never be
upgraded out of the dead state. A sovereign cell stranded forever.

**The fix, grounded in Mina `permissions.ml` (the `set_verification_key` clause, ~line 77).**
Mina's `Verification_key_perm.fallback_to_signature_with_older_version` pins a *transaction/AIR
version* on the `set_verification_key` permission. The rule:

```
set_verification_key =
  ( Auth_required  (* the proof-or-signature authority required *)
  , Mina_numbers.Txn_version.t )   (* the pinned version *)

(* and the check, paraphrased: *)
if stored_txn_version < current_txn_version
then  (* the pinned proof system is STALE: a proof against it can't be trusted/checked *)
      fall back to requiring the OWNER'S SIGNATURE
else  require the configured (proof) authority
```

i.e. **`older_version ⇒ signature_fallback`**: when the cell's pinned version is behind the live
verifier, authorization to `set_program` falls back to a signature by the cell's owner — so a
backend/verifier swap can never strand a sovereign cell. (dregg2's migration is otherwise
*stronger* than Mina's — transparent + conservative + content-hash-preserving, `study-mina-relink §4`.)

**Tie to authority.** A `set_program` is itself an authority-bearing turn: it mutates the cell's
own admissibility coalgebra, so it requires the owner subject / a `control`-conferring cap. We link
to `Dregg2.Authority.Positional`: an admitted upgrade is exactly the `intra` arm of the
`Integrity` case-split (the owner acting on its own object), and the `bySignature` fallback is the
*always-available* owner-edge that keeps that arm reachable.

Spec-first: the data (`AirVersion`, `UpgradeAuth`, `setProgramAdmissible`) is real and computable;
the keystones (`upgrade_never_bricks`, `stale_version_falls_back_to_signature`) are fully
PROVED and `#assert_axioms`-clean (no `sorry`). They follow directly from `adminBySignature` —
the always-available owner-signature arm — which is the substance of the anti-brick guarantee.
This module additionally ports the proved svenvs self-verification envelope as STANDALONE machinery
(`invariant_intro`/`safety_preservation`/`self_improvement_is_safe`/`genealogy_sound`/
`identity_vouch_unconditional`); see the honesty note at `upgrade_never_bricks` on exactly how
much of that spine the two upgrade keystones consume (the genesis/`bySignature` case, not the
fold).

/-! ## The pinned proof-system version -/

/-- **`AirVersion`** — the pinned proof-system / AIR (algebraic intermediate representation)
version a cell's verifier expects. Lift of Mina's `Mina_numbers.Txn_version.t` carried by the
`set_verification_key` permission. A cell's `Circuit{circuit_hash}` is sound only against a
verifier of the version it was pinned to; a backend/recursion swap bumps the *live* version. -/
abbrev AirVersion := Nat

/-- **`stale stored live`** — the staleness predicate driving Mina's fallback. The cell's
*stored* (pinned) AIR version is older than the *live* verifier's version, so a proof produced
against the stored proof system can no longer be checked/trusted by the live verifier. This is
exactly Mina's `stored_txn_version < current_txn_version` guard. -/

  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (stored < live))

/-! ## How a `set_program` is authorized -/

/-- **`UpgradeAuth`** — the authority backing a `set_program` upgrade, mirroring Mina's two
admissible arms for `set_verification_key`:

* `byProof v` — the new program carries a proof against AIR version `v` (the proof arm); admissible
  only when `v` matches the live verifier (a *current*-version proof).
* `bySignature` — the **owner-signature fallback** (`fallback_to_signature_with_older_version`):
  the cell's owner signs the upgrade. Always available to the owner, independent of any proof
  system, so it is the arm that survives every backend swap. -/
inductive UpgradeAuth where
  /-- A proof against the carried AIR version (Mina's `Proof` authority). -/
  | byProof (provedVersion : AirVersion)
  /-- The owner-signature fallback (Mina's `Signature`/`fallback_to_signature…`). -/
  | bySignature
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-! ## Admissibility of a `set_program` turn -/

/-- **`setProgramAdmissible live stored auth`** — a `set_program` turn is admissible iff EITHER
the upgrade carries a **valid current-version proof** (`byProof v` with `v = live`), OR it carries
the **owner's signature** (`bySignature`). This is the disjunction Mina's permission check
computes, and it is *fail-open to the owner*: the signature arm is unconditionally admissible.

The companion `older_version ⇒ signature_fallback` rule (Mina's actual branch) is the lemma
`stale_version_falls_back_to_signature` below: when `stale stored live`, the proof arm against the
stored version is *not* admissible (its version ≠ live), so the only remaining admissible arm is
`bySignature` — the check never silently rejects, it routes to the fallback. -/
def setProgramAdmissible (live _stored : AirVersion) : UpgradeAuth → Prop
  | .byProof v   => v = live              -- a *current*-version proof

  · exact inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))
  · exact inferInstanceAs (Decidable True)

/-- **`adminBySignature`** — the always-true witness that the signature arm is admissible at any
versions. The computable core of the anti-brick guarantee: regardless of `live`/`stored`, the
owner can sign. (Cheap, so proved, not `sorry`'d.) -/

    setProgramAdmissible live _stored UpgradeAuth.bySignature := trivial

/-! ## The ported self-verification envelope (svenvs → dregg2)

These are a direct Lean RE-DERIVATION of the **proved** HOL4 self-verification envelope from
`~/dev/svenvs` (`systemScript` / `envelopeScript` / `safetyScript` / `upgradeScript` /
`genealogy/genealogyScript`). The envelope is a *generic inductive invariant*: it is toolchain-
and domain-agnostic, so it transfers to dregg2's upgrade model with no new assumption. We prove
it natively here (we import NOTHING from svenvs — no "verified" badge crosses the boundary; the
correspondence is conceptual, the Lean proofs stand on their own kernel) and then INSTANTIATE it
to discharge the two upgrade keystones.

HOL4 → Lean correspondence (the load-bearing map):

| svenvs (HOL4)                       | dregg2 (Lean, here)                                  |

| `enveloped`, `enveloped_step_closed`| `enveloped`, `enveloped_step_closed`                  |
| `safety_preservation`               | `safety_preservation`                                |
| `admissible`, `admit`, `admit_*`    | `Admissible`, `admit`, `admit_keeps_sound`, …        |
| `genealogy_sound` (sound fwd)       | `genealogy_sound`                                     |
| `identity_vouch_unconditional`      | `identity_vouch_unconditional` (the no-Löb case)     |

The upgrade reading of the invariant: the cell's safety predicate is **"unbricked"** =
"an admissible `set_program` authorization exists at the current live/stored version pair." A
sound genesis (unbricked at install) + every admitted step preserving unbricked ⇒ every reachable
version in the upgrade genealogy is unbricked (`upgrade_never_bricks`). The owner-signature edge is
the *non-strengthening* (identity) case: it is `VouchSound` UNCONDITIONALLY — no version
hypothesis, no fixpoint — which is exactly `stale_version_falls_back_to_signature`. -/

/-! ## Instantiating the envelope on the upgrade model

We now read the upgrade keystones as instances of the ported envelope. The judges of the
genealogy are **live verifier versions**; a judge is `unbrickableAt stored` = "from the cell's
pinned `stored` version, an admissible `set_program` authorization exists at this live version."
`vouchesBump` is the forward edge "the recursion backend may bump the live version." -/

/-- **`unbrickableAt stored live`** — the genealogy's judge-soundness predicate: at live version
`live`, a cell pinned to `stored` still has SOME admissible upgrade authorization (it is not
bricked). This is the `jsound` of the upgrade genealogy. -/
def unbrickableAt (stored live : AirVersion) : Prop :=
  ∃ auth : UpgradeAuth, setProgramAdmissible live stored auth

/-- **`bumpEdge`** — the upgrade genealogy's forward edge: "the recursion backend may bump the live
version arbitrarily" (`RecursionBackend`/`FriRecursionBackend`, design §7). As a vouching relation
between live versions it is the TOTAL relation — a backend swap can move the live verifier to any
version. The point of the keystone is that unbrickability survives this maximally-adversarial
edge. -/
def bumpEdge (_ _ : AirVersion) : Prop := True

/-- **`signatureVouchUnbrickable`** — the upgrade-model instance of `identity_vouch_unconditional`:
the forward-step seam `VouchSound (unbrickableAt stored) bumpEdge` is a THEOREM, not an assumption,
because the owner-signature edge is NON-STRENGTHENING. It adds no proof-system dependence, so a
cell unbricked before a bump stays unbricked after ANY bump — the signature fallback re-witnesses
unbrickability at the new live version with no version hypothesis. This is exactly svenvs's
"the non-strengthening (owner) case needs no Löb": there is no fixpoint here, just the
unconditional availability of `bySignature`. -/
theorem signatureVouchUnbrickable (stored : AirVersion) :
    VouchSound (unbrickableAt stored) bumpEdge := by
  -- Non-strengthening: the conclusion `unbrickableAt stored B` is witnessed by `bySignature`
  -- regardless of `A` or the (total) edge — no hypothesis on the bump is consumed.
  intro _A B _hA _hAB
  exact ⟨UpgradeAuth.bySignature, adminBySignature B stored⟩

/-- **`unbrickableGenesis`** — the genesis of the upgrade genealogy is sound: at the install-time
live version the cell is unbricked (the owner can always sign). The single irreducibly-assumed
soundness, exactly svenvs's `jsound (J 0)` — except here it is itself a theorem, since
`bySignature` is unconditional. -/
theorem unbrickableGenesis (stored live : AirVersion) : unbrickableAt stored live :=
  ⟨UpgradeAuth.bySignature, adminBySignature live stored⟩

/-- **`upgradeGenealogy_sound`** — the upgrade-model instance of `genealogy_sound`. Fix the cell's
pinned `stored` version and let the live verifier walk an ARBITRARY forward line `Jline : Nat →
AirVersion` (any sequence of backend bumps — `bumpEdge` is total, so this captures every possible
recursion-backend swap genealogy). Sound genesis (`unbrickableGenesis`) + the unconditional
non-strengthening seam (`signatureVouchUnbrickable`) ⇒ EVERY reachable live version keeps the cell
unbricked. This is the genealogy-shaped forward certification svenvs proves
(`genealogy_sound`: sound at genesis ⇒ sound forward), specialized to upgrades — no Löb, the
owner-signature edge carries it. -/
theorem upgradeGenealogy_sound (stored : AirVersion) (Jline : Nat → AirVersion) :
    ∀ n, unbrickableAt stored (Jline n) :=
  genealogy_sound
    (jsound := unbrickableAt stored) (vouches := bumpEdge)
    (signatureVouchUnbrickable stored)
    (unbrickableGenesis stored (Jline 0))
    (fun _ => trivial)  -- ForwardCertified bumpEdge Jline: every step is a (total) backend bump.

/-! ## The keystone: no backend swap can brick a cell -/

/-- **`upgrade_never_bricks`** — THE keystone law. For *any* backend/verifier swap, i.e. any pair
of pinned/live AIR versions `stored`, `live` (the recursion backend may bump the live version
arbitrarily — `RecursionBackend`/`FriRecursionBackend`, design §7), there **exists** an admissible
`set_program` authorization. Hence a cell can never become permanently unupgradeable / bricked:
the signature fallback is always a path out.

The honest existential here is non-trivial content: it asserts the admissibility *relation is total
over version pairs*, which is precisely what fails for a naive proof-only permission (where
`stale stored live` would make every `byProof` arm inadmissible and strand the cell).

**WHERE THE PROOF COMES FROM (honest citation).** This follows from `adminBySignature` alone: the
`bySignature` arm of `setProgramAdmissible` is `True` unconditionally, so the existential witness
is just `⟨bySignature, trivial⟩` at *any* `live`/`stored`. We route it through
`upgradeGenealogy_sound stored (fun _ => live) 0` only to exhibit the connection to the ported
svenvs envelope, but that route is NOT load-bearing: `bumpEdge := True` makes the forward edge
vacuous, so `genealogy_sound`'s induction does no work here beyond returning its *genesis*
(`n = 0`) witness — and that genesis (`unbrickableGenesis`) is itself just `⟨bySignature, …⟩`.
In other words, unbrickability is the *unconditional non-strengthening case* (the owner can
always sign), exactly svenvs's "no Löb needed" reading; the genealogy fold is genuine standalone
machinery (`genealogy_sound`, proved below) but it is the always-available owner edge, not the
forward certification, that carries this keystone. -/
theorem upgrade_never_bricks (live stored : AirVersion) :
    ∃ auth : UpgradeAuth, setProgramAdmissible live stored auth :=
  -- The witness is the unconditional `bySignature` arm; we read it off the genesis node of
  -- `upgradeGenealogy_sound` (whose forward edge is vacuous, so only the genesis is used).
  upgradeGenealogy_sound stored (fun _ => live) 0

-- Axiom-hygiene pin: `upgrade_never_bricks` is `sorry`-free and depends only on the three standard
-- kernel axioms (the Lean-native cousin of svenvs's `verify-claims.sh`). Errors on any `sorryAx`.
#assert_axioms upgrade_never_bricks

/-- **`stale_version_falls_back_to_signature`** — the `older_version ⇒ signature_fallback` rule,
verbatim from Mina's `fallback_to_signature_with_older_version`. When the stored AIR version is
stale (older than the live verifier's), the ONLY admissible authorization is `bySignature`:
the proof arm against any non-live version is inadmissible, so the check **falls back to a
signature rather than silently rejecting**. Two conjuncts:

1. `bySignature` is admissible (the fallback is reachable), and
2. a proof against the *stored* (stale) version is **not** admissible — establishing that the
   fallback is genuinely the operative arm, not a redundant one.

**WHERE THE PROOF COMES FROM (honest citation).** Both conjuncts are direct, NOT routed through
the envelope. The signature conjunct is `adminBySignature` (the `bySignature` arm is `True`
unconditionally — the same "owner can always sign / no Löb needed" non-strengthening fact that
`signatureVouchUnbrickable` packages, but here we use it raw, since no fold is involved). The
negative conjunct — that the proof arm against a stale stored version is dead — is a property of
the version order: `setProgramAdmissible live stored (byProof stored)` reduces to `stored = live`,
contradicting `stale stored live = stored < live`. The envelope spine
(`identity_vouch_unconditional` etc.) is proved standalone below; this keystone does not consume
its fold. -/

/-- **`current_version_admits_proof`** — the complementary (non-stale) branch: when the stored
version is up to date (`stored = live`), a proof against it is admissible without needing the
signature fallback. Together with `stale_version_falls_back_to_signature` this exhausts Mina's
`if stored < current then … else …` branch, showing the disjunction is decidable and total. -/

/-! ## Link to authority: a `set_program` is an authority-bearing turn -/

/-- **`UpgradeTurn`** — a reified `set_program` turn: it carries the cell's `owner`, the set of
acting `subjects`, the live/stored versions, and the offered `UpgradeAuth`. A `set_program` mutates
the cell's *own* admissibility coalgebra, so it is an authority-bearing turn on the cell-as-object,
to be discharged through the `Integrity` case-split of `Authority.Positional`. -/

  owner    : Label
  subjects : List Label
  live     : AirVersion
  stored   : AirVersion
  auth     : UpgradeAuth

/-- **`ownerHoldsControl caps owner`** — the cell-side precondition that the owner holds a
`control`-conferring cap on itself (a `.node owner` cap, `capAuthConferred = [control]`). A
`set_program` is admissible *as an authority matter* only if the actor holds `control`, exactly
as a `node`/`Control` cap is required in l4v for a self-modifying operation. -/
def ownerHoldsControl (caps : Caps) (owner : Label) : Prop :=
  Cap.node owner ∈ caps owner

/-- **`AuthorizedUpgrade caps t`** — the full authorization precondition of a `set_program` turn,
bundling the THREE things an admitted owner-upgrade must establish:

1. the owner holds `control` on itself (`ownerHoldsControl` — the l4v `Control`-cap requirement
   for a self-modifying operation),
2. the owner is among the acting subjects (the `intra`/`troa_lrefl` side condition), and
3. the offered authority is admissible at the live/stored versions (`setProgramAdmissible` — a
   current-version proof OR the owner-signature fallback).

This is the proposition that makes the upgrade an *authorized intra act* rather than a bare
own-it self-edge: all three conjuncts are load-bearing for `upgrade_is_authorized_intra`. -/
def AuthorizedUpgrade (caps : Caps) (t : UpgradeTurn) : Prop :=
  ownerHoldsControl caps t.owner ∧
    t.owner ∈ t.subjects ∧
    setProgramAdmissible t.live t.stored t.auth

/-- **`upgrade_is_authorized_intra`** — the link to the integrity case-split, stated so the
authorization preconditions are LOAD-BEARING. An *authorized* `set_program` by the cell's owner
(it holds `control`, it is among the subjects, AND the offered authority is admissible) both

* **satisfies the upgrade's admissibility / version-pin** (`setProgramAdmissible … t.auth`, so a
  stale-proof authorization could NOT have reached this conclusion — `hadm` is operative), and
* **stands in the `intra` arm of `Integrity`** (l4v `troa_lrefl`: the owning subject may make an
  arbitrary change to its own object — here, swap its own program).

Both conjuncts of the conclusion are needed: the first witnesses that the authorization actually
cleared Mina's `set_verification_key` check (had `t.auth` been a stale `byProof`, `hadm` would be
unavailable and the theorem would not apply), the second is the integrity discharge. The
`bySignature` fallback is what keeps the admissibility conjunct *satisfiable* across a backend
swap, so the cell's owner never loses the authority to re-pin its verifier.

This replaces the earlier `upgrade_is_intra_authority`, whose conclusion was the bare
`Integrity.intra hsub` — making `hctrl`/`hadm` decorative (the `intra` arm consults neither the
control cap nor admissibility). Here both are consumed: `hctrl` via `ownerHoldsControl`-bundling
and `hadm` as the first conjunct.

`W`, `P`, `KO`, `p` are the witness/predicate/cell-object parameters of `Integrity`; `KO` is the
abstract cell-object state, unconnected to the upgrade data, so the `ko ⟶ ko'` change itself is
unconstrained — what the authorization controls is *whether the change is admitted*, captured by
the admissibility conjunct. -/

/-- **`owner_change_is_intra`** — the bare structural fact, honestly named and scoped. With NO
authorization claim, the only thing the `intra` arm needs is `owner ∈ subjects`; merely *owning*
the object (being among its subjects) suffices for the l4v `troa_lrefl` arm. This is deliberately
weak — it does NOT assert the upgrade was authorized — and is kept separate from
`upgrade_is_authorized_intra` so that the authorization preconditions are never silently dropped
into a decorative position. -/
