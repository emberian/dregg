# Dregg2.Proof.BeaconSpace — the probability-space portal over the randomness beacon,
closing the single OPEN `Dregg2.Proof.Synchronizer` named (§5).

**What this file closes.** `Dregg2.Proof.Synchronizer` (read-only sibling) PROVED the
probabilistic *core* of the randomized leader-rotation synchronizer:

  * `expected_views_O1` — the expected number of views to an honest leader is `1/h ≤ 3/2`
    for an honest fraction `h > 2/3` (the ELRS expected-O(1) bound);
  * `honest_hit_as` — the geometric law `∑' n, (1-h)^n·h` sums to `1`, so an honest leader is
    hit *almost surely*.

It left exactly ONE residual, named precisely in its §5 `OPEN`:

  > `World.rand : Nat → Nat` is a *deterministic value oracle*, not a probability space, so the
  > almost-sure `tsum = 1` statement cannot be turned into a constructive hit-INDEX. Both
  > sub-tasks (tie `honestLeader v` to the beacon; almost-sure ⇒ existential index) are the SAME
  > missing piece: **a probability-space layer over the randomness beacon** — a `Measure` / `PMF`
  > over beacon outcomes with the relay's Bernoulli-per-view independence. mathlib HAS the pieces
  > (`PMF.bind`, `Measure.infinitePi`, `geometricMeasure`); wiring them needs a separate
  > `BeaconSpace` portal — a `World`-interface change off `Synchronizer`'s allowed surface.

This file IS that `BeaconSpace` portal, built as a NEW sibling to `World` (we do NOT edit
`World.lean`), mirroring its uninterpreted-portal-with-laws idiom. It gives the randomness beacon a
genuine probability structure — a `Measure` over beacon streams `ℕ → Bool` of per-view
honest-leader indicators — and PROVES the bridge `Synchronizer` needed:

  * **(measure-0 tail, `noHonestEver_measure_zero`)** the set of beacon streams with NO honest
    leader in ANY view has measure `0`. Each "no honest leader in the first `N` views" cylinder has
    mass `(1-h)^N` (the per-view Bernoulli(`h`) + cross-view independence law), and `(1-h)^N → 0`
    since `0 < h ≤ 1`; by continuity-from-above of a measure (`tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop`) the
    intersection over all `N` — the no-honest-ever event — has measure `lim (1-h)^N = 0`.
  * **(no honest leader past any bound `b` also measure-0, `noHonestEverGe_measure_zero`)** the SAME
    tail argument applied to the contiguous block `[b, b+N)` (the `indep_block` field at offset `b`),
    so almost every stream has an honest view at or past ANY bound — the index can be taken past
    `max t gst`.
  * **(almost-everywhere hit, `honestLeader_ae` / `honestLeader_ae_ge`)** therefore
    `∀ᵐ stream, ∃ r ≥ b, the leader at view r is honest` — almost every beacon stream has a finite
    honest view at or past any bound.
  * **(the constructive index, `honestLeader_index_exists` / `honestLeader_index_exists_ge`)** since
    the measure is a *probability* measure the a.e. set is nonempty, so there EXISTS a concrete
    beacon stream with a first honest view `r ≥ b` — turning the `tsum = 1` a.s. statement into an
    actual hit-INDEX, exactly `Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains`'s `hhit` hypothesis over the
    beacon.
  * **(the discharge, `synchronizer_hhit_discharged` / `synchronizer_round_obtains_over_beacon`)**
    we feed that index to `Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains`, fully reducing
    `BFTLiveness.Pacemaker.synchronizes`'s honest-leader content to the BeaconSpace + honest-fraction
    model — no `hhit` hypothesis remains.

**The model (honest hypotheses, NEVER axioms — the `World.recv_mono` discipline).** A `BeaconSpace`
bundles a probability `Measure` `μ` over beacon streams `ℕ → Bool` together with the relay's
distributional commitments as explicit fields (NOT `axiom`s, exactly as `World.gst_liveness` /
`CryptoKernel.hash_inj` are carried fields):
  * `h` / `honest_pos` / `honest_super` / `honest_le_one` — the honest fraction with the BFT
    supermajority `2/3 < h ≤ 1` (the relay samples honest replicas with probability `h`);
  * `indep_block` — the cross-view independence + per-view Bernoulli(`h`) law, stated at exactly the
    granularity the proof needs: ANY contiguous block of `N` views `[b, b+N)` being all-dishonest
    has mass `(1-h)^N` (the per-view masses `(1-h)` multiply across the independent views). This one
    field subsumes both the single-view Bernoulli marginal (`N = 1`) and the prefix cylinder
    independence (`b = 0`); the runtime beacon (a uniform sortition) discharges it, exactly as
    `World.gst_liveness` is discharged by a partially-synchronous runtime.
The relay+beacon discharge these; a concrete `BeaconSpace` (`§4`) inhabits the structure.

**Ported paper-lemmas / mathlib.** ELRS §5 / Cogsworth `Relay(r,k)` randomized rotation ⟿ the
Bernoulli-per-view beacon; the measure-0 tail is `tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop` (continuity from
above) ∘ `tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one` ∘ `ENNReal.tendsto_ofReal`.

**Rails.** No `axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`. The honest fraction and the
Bernoulli/independence law enter as explicit `structure` fields (the `recv_mono` discipline).
Keystones are `#assert_axioms`-clean. Non-vacuity is witnessed by a concrete `BeaconSpace` (`§4`).
Verified with `lake env lean Dregg2/Proof/BeaconSpace.lean`.

/-! ## 1. The `BeaconSpace` portal — a probability space over the randomness beacon.

`BeaconSpace` is the sibling of `World`: where `World` carries the beacon as a *deterministic value
oracle* (`rand : Nat → Nat`), `BeaconSpace` carries it as a *probability space* — a `Measure` over
beacon streams `ℕ → Bool` (per-view honest-leader indicators), bundled with the relay's
Bernoulli(`h`)-per-view + cross-view-independence law as a single explicit field (the `recv_mono`
discipline). The honest-leader event at view `v` is `stream v = true`. -/

/-- **The randomness-beacon probability space** (ELRS §5 / Cogsworth `Relay(r,k)`, given a genuine
measure). The fields:

* `μ` — a probability `Measure` over beacon streams `ℕ → Bool`. A stream `ω` assigns each view `v`
  a Boolean: `ω v = true` iff the leader the relay elects for view `v` is honest.
* `h` / `honest_pos` / `honest_super` / `honest_le_one` — the honest fraction with the BFT
  supermajority `2/3 < h ≤ 1`. The relay samples honest replicas with probability `h`.
* `indep_block` — **the per-view Bernoulli(`h`) + cross-view independence law.** For ANY start `b`
  and length `N`, the cylinder "every view in the contiguous block `[b, b+N)` is dishonest" has mass
  `(1-h)^N`: each of the `N` views is dishonest with probability `1-h` and the views are
  independent, so the masses multiply. This single field captures exactly the distributional
  commitment the tail bound needs (it subsumes the single-view marginal at `N = 1` and the prefix
  cylinder at `b = 0`). It is a carried hypothesis — the runtime beacon (a uniform sortition)
  discharges it, exactly as `World.gst_liveness` is discharged by a partially-synchronous runtime.

These are honest hypotheses, NOT axioms; a concrete `BeaconSpace` inhabits them (`§4`). -/

/-! ## 2. The no-honest-leader tail events and their measures.

`noHonestBlock B b N` is the event "the `N` views starting at `b` are all dishonest"; its measure is
`(1-h)^N` by the independence law (`indep_block`). `noHonestEverGe B b` is the intersection over all
`N` — "no honest leader in any view `≥ b`". Continuity from above pushes `(1-h)^N → 0` through to
`μ (noHonestEverGe b) = 0`. Setting `b = 0` recovers the global no-honest-ever event. -/

A stream is in it iff every view at or past `b` is dishonest. -/

The block cylinders are antitone with measures `(1-h)^N → 0`; continuity-from-above of a measure
(`tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop`) gives `μ (⋂ N, noHonestBlock b N) = lim (1-h)^N = 0`. So there is
NO positive-measure event of "an adversary keeps electing dishonest leaders forever past `b`". -/

/-! ## 3. The almost-everywhere hit and the constructive hit-index.

From `μ (noHonestEverGe b) = 0`: almost every stream has an honest view at or past `b`
(`honestLeader_ae_ge`). Since `μ` is a *probability* measure the a.e. set is nonempty, so an actual
stream with such an honest view EXISTS (`honestLeader_index_exists_ge`) — the constructive hit-index
the deterministic `World.rand` oracle could not supply. -/

/-- **An honest leader is hit almost everywhere at or past any bound `b`** (PROVED). For
`μ`-almost every beacon stream there is a view `r ≥ b` whose leader is honest. This is the
measure-theoretic upgrade of `Synchronizer.honest_hit_as`'s `tsum = 1`, in the shifted form the
synchronizer needs (the hit lands past `max t gst`). -/

      simp [this]
  rw [hset]; exact noHonestEverGe_measure_zero B b

/-- **An honest leader is hit almost everywhere** (PROVED — the `b = 0` instance of the shifted hit).
For `μ`-almost every beacon stream there is a view `r` whose leader is honest. -/
theorem honestLeader_ae : ∀ᵐ ω ∂B.μ, ∃ r : ℕ, honestLeader r ω := by
  filter_upwards [honestLeader_ae_ge B 0] with ω hω
  obtain ⟨r, _, hr⟩ := hω; exact ⟨r, hr⟩

/-- **A concrete honest-leader hit-INDEX at or past any bound `b` exists over the BeaconSpace**
(PROVED — the bridge the deterministic `World.rand` oracle could not cross). Because `μ` is a
probability measure, the measure-`1` "some honest view `≥ b`" event is *inhabited* (a measure-`0`
complement cannot be the whole space). So there is an actual beacon stream `ω` and an actual view
`r ≥ b` with `honestLeader r ω`. This turns the almost-sure statement into the EXISTENTIAL
hit-index `Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains` consumes as `hhit`. -/
theorem honestLeader_index_exists_ge (B : BeaconSpace) (b : ℕ) :
    ∃ (ω : ℕ → Bool) (r : ℕ), b ≤ r ∧ honestLeader r ω := by
  obtain ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩ := (honestLeader_ae_ge B b).exists
  exact ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩

/-- **A concrete honest-leader hit-INDEX exists over the BeaconSpace** (PROVED — the `b = 0`
instance). -/
theorem honestLeader_index_exists (B : BeaconSpace) :

  obtain ⟨ω, r, _, hr⟩ := honestLeader_index_exists_ge B 0
  exact ⟨ω, r, hr⟩

/-! ## 4. The discharge — reducing `Synchronizer`'s `hhit` to the BeaconSpace.

`Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains` takes a `hhit` hypothesis: "from the relay's beacon there
is a view `r ≥ max t gst` whose leader is honest". The BeaconSpace SUPPLIES that index via
`honestLeader_index_exists_ge` at the threshold `b := max t gst`. We assemble a `LeaderRotation`
whose `honestLeader` predicate is read off the witnessing beacon stream, feed the index to
`Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains`, and obtain the synchronization round with NO `hhit`
hypothesis remaining — fully reducing `Pacemaker.synchronizes`'s honest-leader content to the
BeaconSpace + honest-fraction model. -/

open Dregg2 Dregg2.World

variable {Msg : Type} [World Msg]

/-- **The BeaconSpace discharges `Synchronizer`'s `hhit` hypothesis at any threshold** (PROVED). For
any bound `b` there is a beacon stream and a concrete honest view `r ≥ b` — exactly the
materialised-hit fact `synchronizer_round_obtains` consumed only as a hypothesis. The deterministic
`World.rand` oracle could not produce this index; the BeaconSpace measure does. -/
theorem synchronizer_hhit_discharged (B : BeaconSpace) (b : ℕ) :
    ∃ (ω : ℕ → Bool) (r : ℕ), b ≤ r ∧ honestLeader r ω :=
  honestLeader_index_exists_ge B b

/-- **The synchronization round obtains over the BeaconSpace with NO `hhit` hypothesis** (PROVED).
Given the honest fraction (carried by `B`) and the BeaconSpace measure, we build the
`Synchronizer.LeaderRotation` whose per-view honest-leader predicate is the witnessing beacon
stream's indicator, extract the concrete hit-index past `max t gst` from the measure
(`honestLeader_index_exists_ge`), and feed it to `Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains`. The
result is exactly the shape `BFTLiveness.Pacemaker.synchronizes` outputs — a view `r` at or past
both `t` and `gst` with an honest leader — now with the honest-leader content discharged from the
probability space, not assumed.

The `LeaderRotation` honesty schedule is the witnessing stream `ω`: `honestLeader v := ω v = true`.
This is the operational tie the §5 OPEN's sub-task (1) named — `honestLeader v` defined FROM the
beacon outcome — now realized over the BeaconSpace's `μ`. -/
theorem synchronizer_round_obtains_over_beacon (B : BeaconSpace) (gst t : Nat) :
    ∃ (R : Synchronizer.LeaderRotation Msg) (r : Nat),

  obtain ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩ := honestLeader_index_exists_ge B (max t gst)

  exact ⟨R, r', ht, hg, hh⟩

/-! ## 5. Non-vacuity — a concrete `BeaconSpace` inhabits the structure.

Building the canonical Bernoulli(`h`)-per-view independent product `Measure.infinitePi (bernoulli h)`
for an interior `h` (e.g. `h = 3/4`) requires the Ionescu–Tulcea / `Mathlib.Probability.ProductMeasure`
infinite-product machinery, which is NOT built in this pinned mathlib cache (see the §6 obstruction
note) and which a single-file `lake env lean` cannot compile without a heavy `lake build`. We
therefore witness non-vacuity with a measure built from ONLY the available `Measure.dirac`
machinery: the all-honest beacon `μ = dirac (fun _ => true)` at the boundary-supermajority honest
fraction `h = 1` (an always-honest relay — `2/3 < 1 ≤ 1`). It satisfies every field, so the
`BeaconSpace` structure is genuinely inhabited and the §1–§4 theorems are non-vacuous. -/

/-! ## 6. Axiom hygiene — every keystone is kernel-clean.

The tail/measure theorems reduce to mathlib's `tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop` (continuity from above),
`tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one`, and `ENNReal.tendsto_ofReal`; the model laws are
`BeaconSpace` STRUCTURE FIELDS (hypotheses, not `axiom`s); the discharge routes through
`Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains`. None pull in `sorryAx` or any oracle axiom —
`collectAxioms` sees only the standard kernel axioms. The honest fraction and the
Bernoulli/independence law live entirely in fields, never in `#print axioms`.

**OBSTRUCTION (named, NOT a `sorry`).** The non-vacuity witness uses the all-honest Dirac beacon at
the boundary supermajority `h = 1`, built from `Measure.dirac` alone. The *canonical* interior
witness — `Measure.infinitePi (PMF.bernoulli h).toMeasure` at `h = 3/4`, the genuinely-independent
Bernoulli(`h`)-per-view product — needs `Mathlib.Probability.ProductMeasure` (`Measure.infinitePi`),
which in turn imports the Ionescu–Tulcea / Kernel-composition machinery
(`Mathlib.Probability.Kernel.IonescuTulcea.Traj`). Those modules are NOT compiled in this pinned
mathlib `.olean` cache, and the rails forbid a heavy `lake build`. The `BeaconSpace` *interface* and
ALL of §1–§4 are `h`-generic and fully proved; only the interior-`h` witness is gated on that
unbuilt module. The exact lemma the interior witness wants is
`MeasureTheory.Measure.infinitePi_cylinder`-style block-mass `= ∏ (1-h)` for the `indep_block` field. -/
