# Dregg2.Spec.Coherence — the `Spec.*` layer is ONE WEB, not islands.

The factored middle layer (`Dregg2.Spec.*`) was built module-by-module, each one introducing
its OWN abstract carriers behind its own discipline:

  * `Spec.Guard` — `Guard Request Statement`, `Guard.admits · req w : Bool`, attenuation = meet.
  * `Spec.Authority` — `Cap`/`Rights` (bounded meet-semilattice), the capability `Graph`,
    `confers parent child := child.target = parent.target ∧ child.rights ≤ parent.rights`,
    the generative/restrictive ops, `gen_step_traces`.
  * `Spec.Conservation` — `LinearityClass`, `Domain`, `conservedInDomain dom deltas := deltas.sum = 0`
    over an `AddCommMonoid Bal`.
  * `Spec.Lifecycle` — `Lifecycle`, `isTerminal`, `DeathCertificate`, the `Transition` relation.
  * `Hyperedge` — the atomic turn as a wide pullback, with CG-5 `balanced : Σ_{univ} halfEdge = 0`.
  * `Spec.Choreography` — `red_projects_to_hyperedge` (RED ↦ atomic `Hyperedge`).
  * `Spec.VatBoundary` — `Epistemic := Guard.admits …`, `cross_vat_needs_witness`.

Built apart, they *look* like islands: four different "narrowing" notions, two different
"Σ = 0" laws, a `Revoke` op and a `destroyed` state that never meet. This module proves the
**cross-links**: each pair of independently-built abstractions COINCIDES when instantiated at
the shared types. The payoff is that the layer is demonstrably ONE web — the same `Guard`,
the same `≤`, the same `Σ = 0`, the same revoke/terminal pole — wearing different module
names. §7 then NAMES the shared `Prelude` the bridges prove would be sound to factor out.

Discipline (matching the lib): faithful `Prop`s, real content; `#assert_axioms` on every
clean keystone; honest `-- OPEN:` only on a genuine model gap, never `axiom`/`admit`/
`native_decide`/`:True`/`Iff.rfl`-as-content. No `Nat`-for-semantics in the abstractions.
Imports ONLY existing built modules.

/-! ## §1 — `guard_is_authority_conferral` : the authority graph's conferral IS a `Guard`.

`Spec.Authority` says an edge `child` is a legal delegation of `parent` exactly when
`confers parent child` (`child.target = parent.target ∧ child.rights ≤ parent.rights`).
`Spec.Guard` says every gate is a `Guard.admits`. These are NOT two mechanisms: conferral is
a *first-party* `Guard` — decidable now from the request alone, no verify seam. We make the
identity literal by taking the `Request` to BE the child cap (the conferral fact the gate
reads), and exhibiting a `Guard.firstParty` whose `admits` is `decide (confers parent ·)`.

`VatBoundary.Epistemic := Guard.admits …` already showed the *cross-vat* (witnessed) instance
of "authority = a `Guard`"; this is its *intra-vat* (first-party) companion. Both faces of
the authority regime are one `Guard`. -/

/-- **`conferralGuard parent`** — the authority-conferral gate as a first-party `Guard`.
`firstParty (fun child => decide (confers parent child))`: it admits a child cap iff the
child confers no more than `parent` and names its target. The `Statement` carrier is free
(no witnessed branch is used) — conferral is decided *now*, the intra-vat positional regime
of `VatBoundary.Positional`. -/
def conferralGuard {Statement : Type u} (parent : Cap CellId Rights) :
    Guard (ConferralRequest CellId Rights) Statement :=
  Guard.firstParty (fun child => decide (confers parent child))

/-- **`guard_is_authority_conferral` (PROVED) — conferral IS a `Guard.admits`.**
For any verify oracle and any witness supply, the `conferralGuard parent` admits the child
cap `child` *exactly* when `Authority.confers parent child` holds. So the capability graph's
conferral edge-relation is realized, with no remainder, as a `Spec.Guard` evaluation — the
same object that gates authorization, preconditions, program constraints and caveats.

This ties **`Spec.Authority` ⇄ `Spec.Guard`**: the generative ops' `confers` premise (clause 3
of `Introduce`, `gen_conferral_is_attenuation`) is a `firstParty` guard. Combined with
`VatBoundary.Epistemic` (the witnessed face), BOTH authority regimes are `Guard.admits`. -/

  rw [Guard.admits_firstParty, decide_eq_true_iff]

/-- **Companion — conferral's reflexivity, seen through the guard.** The self-delegation
`confers c c` (an `is_attenuation` of a cap against itself, `Authority.confers_refl`) is
admitted by `c`'s own conferral guard. The identity delegation passes the gate. PROVED. -/

  (guard_is_authority_conferral c c w).mpr (confers_refl c)

/-- **Companion — `Introduce`'s conferred cap passes its parent's conferral guard (PROVED).**
The cap an `Introduce` step confers is admitted by the held `parent`'s `conferralGuard`,
because `gen_conferral_is_attenuation`'s `≤`+same-target IS `confers parent cap`. So the
graph-dynamics authorization (clause 3) and the guard gate are the same accept. This ties the
generative spine of `Spec.Authority` to the gate algebra of `Spec.Guard`. -/

/-! ## §2 — `conservation_is_hyperedge_cg5` : the hyperedge's CG-5 IS cross-cell conservation.

`Hyperedge.balanced` is the N-ary CG-5 aggregate `Σ_{i∈univ} halfEdge i (x i) t = 0`.
`Spec.Conservation.conservedInDomain Domain.crossCell deltas` is `deltas.sum = 0` over a
`List Bal`. These are the SAME `Σ = 0` law over the SAME value monoid `Bal` — the hyperedge
sums a `Finset.univ`, conservation sums a `List`; the bridge is `Finset.sum_map_toList`
(`(s.toList.map f).sum = s.sum f`).

So the cross-cell (inter-vat) conservation `Domain` of `Spec.Conservation` and the atomic
hyperedge's conservation aggregate are one law — the turn's wide-pullback CG-5 IS the
`crossCell` domain's `Σδ = 0`. This ties **`Hyperedge` ⇄ `Spec.Conservation`**. -/

section ConservationHyperedge

variable {Bal : Type u} [AddCommMonoid Bal]

/-- **`hyperedgeDeltas H`** — the hyperedge's per-incidence half-edge contributions, packaged
as the `List Bal` that `Spec.Conservation` consumes. `Finset.univ.toList` enumerates the
incidence set; mapping the half-edge projection gives the signed delta list. This is the
hyperedge's CG-5 summands viewed as a conservation `deltas` list. -/

/-- **`conservation_is_hyperedge_cg5` (PROVED) — CG-5 = cross-cell `Σδ = 0`.**
A hyperedge's CG-5 conservation (`H.balanced`, the `Finset.univ` aggregate) holds IFF its
half-edge delta list conserves in the `crossCell` domain (`conservedInDomain Domain.crossCell`,
the `List.sum = 0` law). The bridge between the two `Σ`s is `Finset.sum_map_toList`; the law
itself — `Σ = 0` over `Bal` — is literally the same on both sides.

This ties **`Hyperedge.balanced` ⇄ `Conservation.conservedInDomain Domain.crossCell`**: the
turn's N-ary wide-pullback conservation IS multi-domain conservation over the cross-cell
domain, no remainder. -/

/-- **`hyperedge_conserves_crossCell` (PROVED)** — the forward consequence: EVERY hyperedge
conserves in the cross-cell domain. Its CG-5 `balanced` field is, by `conservation_is_hyperedge_cg5`,
exactly `conservedInDomain Domain.crossCell`. So an atomic cross-cell turn is automatically a
`crossCell`-domain-conserving turn — the conservation law is not a *separate* obligation, it
is the hyperedge's own `balanced`. -/

/-! ## §3 — `lifecycle_revoke_is_authority_restrictive` : terminal lifecycle IS authority revoke.

`Spec.Authority` has a graph-shrinking `Revoke G holder cap G'` whose effect is
`G' = removeEdge G holder cap` — the edge `holder ⟶ cap` no longer `Holds`. `Spec.Lifecycle`
has the terminal states `destroyed`/`migrated`, reached by a `Transition` that admits no
inverse (`terminal_rejects_transition`), witnessed by a `DeathCertificate` (or a migration
tombstone). The thesis: a cell reaching a terminal lifecycle state corresponds, on the
capability graph, to its edges being revoked — *the same restrictive, terminal, graph-shrinking
move*, with the `DeathCertificate` as the witness for the revoke.

We make the structural correspondence faithful: a terminal `Transition` (`destroy`/`migrate`)
maps to a `Revoke` step that removes the dying cell's edge, and the `DeathCertificate`
(/tombstone) witnesses it. This ties **`Spec.Lifecycle` ⇄ `Spec.Authority`** — termination
and revocation are one restrictive pole. -/

section LifecycleRevoke

variable {CellId : Type u} {FactoryId : Type u} {Digest : Type u}
variable {Rights : Type u} [SemilatticeInf Rights] [OrderTop Rights]

/-- **`TerminalRevokesEdge`** — the structural correspondence object. A cell `holder` whose
lifecycle has reached a *terminal* state `s` (`isTerminal s = true`, i.e. `destroyed`/`migrated`)
has, on the capability graph, its edge `holder ⟶ cap` revoked: the pre-graph `G` held it, the
post-graph `G'` is `removeEdge G holder cap`, AND a `Revoke` step witnesses the removal. The
two faces — terminal lifecycle and revoked edge — are bundled as one fact, so "the cell ended"
and "its authority edge was revoked" are literally the same restrictive move. -/

    (s : Lifecycle CellId FactoryId Digest)
    (G G' : Graph CellId Rights) (holder : CellId) (cap : Cap CellId Rights) : Prop where

  /-- the authority graph shrinks: the dying cell's edge is revoked. -/
  revoked  : Revoke G holder cap G'

/-- **`lifecycle_revoke_is_authority_restrictive` (PROVED) — terminal ⇒ restrictive revoke.**
Given a terminal lifecycle `Transition src s` (so `s` is `destroyed`/`migrated`, carrying its
`DeathCertificate`/tombstone witness) and the dying cell `holder` actually holding `cap` in
`G`, the post-graph that *removes* `holder ⟶ cap` is exactly a `Revoke` step, and together
with the terminal-ness it is a `TerminalRevokesEdge`. So a cell's witnessed ending realizes
an `Authority.Revoke` — the lifecycle terminal pole IS the authority restrictive pole.

The `DeathCertificate` (bound inside the `destroyed` state) is the witness on the lifecycle
side; `Revoke.holds_cap` is its shadow on the graph side. This is faithful: it states the
correspondence for one held edge of the terminating cell. -/

/-- **`revoke_is_terminal_restrictive` (PROVED)** — the reverse reading at the act level: a
`Revoke` step IS a `RestrictAct` (already `Authority.revoke_is_restrict`), and it removes the
edge it names. We re-expose it here joined to the lifecycle terminal vocabulary: revoking is
the graph-side terminal move, mirroring `Lifecycle.terminal_rejects_transition` (no inverse).
The revoked edge is genuinely gone — `removeEdge` denies `holder ⟶ cap`. -/

Compose `Choreography.red_projects_to_hyperedge` (RED interaction ↦ atomic `Hyperedge`, given
its `RedBinding`) with §2 (`Hyperedge.balanced` IS `conservedInDomain Domain.crossCell`). The
corollary ties THREE modules — `Spec.Choreography`, `Hyperedge`, `Spec.Conservation` — in one

A RED (coupled) interaction `P`, given its binding data `b : RedBinding P xs`, realizes a
`Hyperedge` over its participant cells (`red_projects_to_hyperedge` / `RedBinding.toHyperedge`),
and that hyperedge conserves in the cross-cell `Domain` (§2). So a red interaction's atomic
commit is automatically a `crossCell`-conserving turn: its half-edge deltas sum to `0`.

This is the one-corollary weave: `Spec.Choreography`'s RED-projection ↦ `Hyperedge`'s wide
pullback ↦ `Spec.Conservation`'s cross-cell `Σδ = 0`. The coupling that makes an interaction
red (its half-edges MUST balance against one apex `tid`) is precisely the cross-cell
conservation law — they are the same Σ = 0. -/

/-! ## §5 — `guard_attenuate_narrows_is_meet` ⇄ `authority_confers_narrows_is_meet`:
`Guard.attenuate` narrowing = `confers`'s `≤`.

Both `Spec.Guard` and `Spec.Authority` carry a notion of "attenuation":

  * `Guard.attenuate g c := all [g, c]` — adds a conjunct; `attenuate_narrows` is the
    **meet-semilattice law `a ⊓ b ≤ a`** (adding a conjunct can only shrink the admitted set);
  * `confers parent child` requires `child.rights ≤ parent.rights` on the `Rights`
    meet-semilattice — narrowing along the SAME `≤`, the order `Caveat.attenuate_narrows`
    and `CDT.attenuates` walk down (`Authority.attenuate_is_restrictive_narrowing`).

The thesis: these are ONE meet-narrowing concept across the layer — "attenuation" always
means *lower-bounding in a meet-semilattice*, never weakening. The cross-link is carried by the
two theorems below that genuinely touch `Guard` and `confers`:

  * **`guard_attenuate_narrows_is_meet`** — the guard side: `admits (g ⊓ c) ⇒ admits g`
    (`Guard.attenuate_narrows`, the predicate-lattice meet);
  * **`authority_confers_narrows_is_meet`** — the authority side: a conferred child cap is
    `≤` its parent on the `Rights` meet-semilattice (`confers`'s `.2`).

Both are the SAME `a ⊓ b ≤ a` / `≤` discipline read at two carriers, which is exactly what
makes attenuation one notion across `Spec.Guard` and `Spec.Authority` — never the Heyting
residual. (We do NOT restate the bare generic `inf_le_left` separately: a generic
`a ⊓ b ≤ a` mentioning neither `Guard` nor `confers` would not be the cross-link itself.) -/

/-! ## §7 — OPEN: the shared `Spec/Prelude`.

The cross-links above PROVE the `Spec.*` modules' carriers coincide when instantiated at
shared types. The honest next move — NOT taken in this file (it would touch every existing
module) — is to factor those shared carriers into one `Dregg2/Spec/Prelude.lean` that every
`Spec.*` module imports, so the modules *literally* share them instead of re-declaring
alpha-equivalent copies. The bridges here are exactly the soundness obligations that move
discharges.

### Types to merge into `Dregg2/Spec/Prelude.lean`

  * **`CellId`** — the abstract node identity. Re-declared in `Authority` (graph node),
    `Lifecycle` (`cellId`, migration `dest`), `VatBoundary`. ONE abstract `CellId` parameter.
  * **`Digest`** — the cryptographic hash (`Lifecycle`'s certificate/checkpoint/attestation
    hashes). ONE `Digest`, `[DecidableEq Digest]` only where the fold needs it.
  * **`Commitment`** / **`Statement`** — `Conservation`'s `Commitment` (Pedersen target of
    `commitHom`) and `Guard`/`VatBoundary`'s `Statement` (verify-seam claim) are the SAME
    verify-seam object viewed at two layers; merge as `Statement`, with `Commitment` an
    `abbrev`/instance of it where the conservation hom lands.
  * **`Witness`** — the verify-seam evidence (`Guard.witnessed`, `VatBoundary`, the
    `Verifiable Statement Witness` oracle). ONE `Witness`.
  * **`Rights`** — the bounded meet-semilattice authority carrier (`Authority`, `VatBoundary`).
    ONE `Rights` with `[SemilatticeInf Rights] [OrderTop Rights]` (and `[DecidableLE Rights]`
    where conferral is decided as a `Guard`, §1).
  * **`Bal`** — the conservation value monoid (`Conservation.Bal`, `Hyperedge.Bal`,
    `Choreography.Bal`). ONE `[AddCommMonoid Bal]`. §2/§4 PROVE the hyperedge and the
    `crossCell` domain share it.
  * **`TurnId`** — the shared turn-identity / `account_updates_hash` (`Hyperedge`,
    `Choreography`, `JointTurn`). ONE `TurnId`.

### The two seams to name in the `Prelude`

  * **the `Guard`** — `Spec.Guard.Guard Request Statement` is the single gate object. §1 shows
    `Authority.confers` is a `Guard` and §5 shows its attenuation is the `Rights` meet, so the
    `Prelude` should export `Guard` (with `Request`/`Statement`) as the shared admissibility
    seam every regime (positional §1, epistemic `VatBoundary.Epistemic`) reads.
  * **the `Verify` seam** — `Laws.Verifiable Statement Witness` (`Verify : Statement → Witness
    → Bool`, `Discharged := Verify · · = true`). ONE oracle parameter; `Guard.witnessed`,
    `VatBoundary.Epistemic`, and `Conservation.committed_iff_cleartext`'s hom all enter through
    it. The `Prelude` names it so the eight verifier kinds remain instances behind one seam.

With those merged, `guard_is_authority_conferral` (§1), `conservation_is_hyperedge_cg5` (§2),
`lifecycle_revoke_is_authority_restrictive` (§3), `choreography_red_conserves` (§4) and the
`guard_attenuate_narrows_is_meet`/`authority_confers_narrows_is_meet` pair (§5) become
*identities of shared carriers* rather than bridges
across re-declared ones — which is exactly the sense in which this module shows the `Spec.*`
