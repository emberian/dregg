# Dregg2.Verify.StripeReserve — the money-in RESERVE (Route α) + the APEX loss-bound.

The Stripe money-in reserve IS the Trustline fullReserve channel (`Apps.Trustline.ChannelC`, design
doc §4.2, "Route α"). The symbol binding:

  * spent-provisional exposure          = `drawn`
  * R (the disclosed reserve line)       = `ceiling`
  * realized reversal loss absorbed      = `settled`
  * reserve fund remaining               = `escrow = R − settled`

Every solvency property is a symbol-binding INSTANCE of the PROVED Trustline theorems — no new proof
of the core. The guarantee is unconditional over the dynamics: for ANY attest/reverse/spend/finalize
schedule (`SSched`), dregg's realized loss never exceeds the reserve R (`net ≥ −R`) and the reserve
fund is never negative — a proved theorem about the reserve `R` (real collateral). The payment
attestation is the `StripeAttest.stripe_attest_sound` gate (see `StripeBridgeV2`), an explicit
hypothesis (the §8 verify predicate).
