//! App-level static checks — the first *application* customers of the static
//! pre-submission toolkit.
//!
//! The four core checks in [`crate`] (conservation, non-amplification,
//! well-formedness, ring-balance) are *protocol-shaped*: they read a
//! [`CallForest`] knowing only the universal `Effect` grammar. But the apps
//! built on dregg are state-machine cells whose meaning lives one level up — in
//! *which slot means what*. The escrow market's conservation is
//! `RELEASED + REFUNDED == ESCROWED` over three specific slots; the provenance
//! log's integrity is a blake3 hash chain over the `ENTRY_BASE + i` slots; the
//! bounty board's safety is a strictly-monotone lifecycle on the `STATE` slot.
//!
//! Those properties are *the executor's own slot-caveat invariants*, restated
//! as static, artifact-only predicates so an app builder can catch a malformed
//! turn before paying gas — exactly as the four core checks do, but in the
//! app's vocabulary. Each app supplies a tiny [`SlotSchema`] (which slots carry
//! which meaning) and the check projects the forest's `SetField` writes through
//! it.
//!
//! These mirror, slot-for-slot, the *real* shipped apps:
//!
//!   * [`check_escrow_conservation`] ← `starbridge-apps/escrow-market`
//!     (`build_settle_action` + the `settle`-scoped `AffineEq
//!     { RELEASED + REFUNDED − ESCROWED = 0 }`). The FLASHWELL organ, statically.
//!   * [`verify_provenance_chain`] / [`check_provenance_chain_in_forest`] ←
//!     `starbridge-apps/agent-provenance` (`verify_chain`, `entry_digests`,
//!     `link_hash` — the blake3 hash chain `entry_i = blake3(prev ‖ claim_i)`).
//!   * [`check_bounty_lifecycle`] ← `starbridge-apps/bounty-board`
//!     (the `StrictMonotonic(STATE)` caveat: `OPEN→CLAIMED→SUBMITTED→PAID`,
//!     no rewind, no re-entry).
//!
//! ## The boundary (same honesty as the core checks)
//!
//! A forest is a *plan*: it carries the `SetField` writes the turn intends. The
//! app check decodes those writes and asserts the app invariant over them. What
//! it does NOT see is the *live cell's current state* — e.g. whether the
//! `ESCROWED` slot was already written by a prior turn (so this forest's
//! `released + refunded` must match *that* committed escrow, not one this forest
//! sets). When the forest itself writes every slot the invariant relates (the
//! common single-turn `settle`, or a full post→claim→submit→payout test
//! forest), the check is exact. When the invariant spans turns, pass the
//! prior-committed values explicitly (the `*_with_prior` entry points) — the
//! check then closes over the whole relation. With neither, the check reports
//! what it can decide and names the slot it could not resolve, never silently
//! passing an unknowable.
